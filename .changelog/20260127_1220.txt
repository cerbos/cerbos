type:fix
Enforce exhaustive role policy allowActions
This fixes a bug introduced in Cerbos v0.48 where roles defined in role policies would gain their parent roles' permissions on any resources not specified in `allowActions`, rather than the expected behaviour of having no permissions on the omitted resources.
