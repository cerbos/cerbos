Avoid activating lenient scope search in checks when it is disabled
This fixes a bug introduced in Cerbos v0.44 where the policy engine could behave as if lenient scope search was enabled when evaluating `CheckResources` requests, even when it was not. To trigger this bug, the policy store needed to include a combination of principal policies and resource or role policies. In this case, the policy engine would perform lenient scope search on a missing resource scope as long as the principal scope existed (or vice versa).
