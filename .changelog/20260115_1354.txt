Add PurgeStoreRevisions RPC
When Cerbos is configured with a database store and the Admin API is used to add/update policies, each operation creates a backup copy of the policies being modified. The `PurgeStoreRevisions` Admin RPC allows deleting those backups to reclaim space. Please note that this feature requires the database user used by the PDP to have `DELETE` privileges on the `policy_revisions` table. If you have an existing deployment, this grant needs to be added manually by a database administrator.
