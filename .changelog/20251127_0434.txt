Simplify plan with all operation
In case a collection is a known value, then `collection.all(t, <bodyExpr>)` can be simplified as a logical AND of the body expr evaluated for each value of `t` in the collection. The collection can be either a map or a list. Both single- and two-var operations are supported.
