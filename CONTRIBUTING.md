  - [AI assistance policy](#ai-assistance-policy)
  - [Code changes](#submitting-pull-requests-for-code-changes)

Submitting pull requests
------------------------

- Before submitting a pull request, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos/issues) in the GitHub repository and provide information about the problem you are trying to fix and how you plan to address it. Include as much detail as possible to make it easier for others to understand your thought process.
- Wait for the project maintainers and other community members to respond to your proposal and clearly agree on a course of action.
- Create your patch, constraining yourself to what was agreed on the issue. If previously unforeseen problems arise and you have to make significant changes to an area that wasn’t discussed in the issue, make sure to go back to the issue to discuss the new circumstances and get buy-in from the people who are involved.
- Run the pre-commit checks that are appropriate for the kind of change. (See below for details.)
- Submit your pull request.
  - We require all pull requests to follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
  - Use [closing keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to link the PR to the original issue.
  - At least one approval from a maintainer is required to merge the pull request.

### AI assistance policy

Our policy on AI-assisted changes is the same as the one adopted by the [Ghostty project](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/1efde5caba2d9f1fbd3e3f1a100f341feca095b4/CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assistance-notice), which is reproduced below with minor edits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to Cerbos,
> it must be disclosed in the pull request.

If you are using any kind of AI assistance while contributing to Cerbos,
**this must be disclosed in the pull request**, along with the extent to
which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation).
If PR responses are being generated by an AI, disclose that as well.
As a small exception, trivial tab-completion doesn't need to be disclosed,
so long as it is limited to single keywords or short phrases.

An example disclosure:

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

Or a more detailed disclosure:

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution
> was fully authored manually by myself.

Failure to disclose this is first and foremost rude to the human operators
on the other end of the pull request, but it also makes it difficult to
determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.

When using AI assistance, we expect contributors to understand the code
that is produced and be able to answer critical questions about it. It
isn't a maintainers job to review a PR so broken that it requires
significant rework to be acceptable.

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.

### Submitting pull requests for code changes

- Write idiomatic Go. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) is the canonical source while the [Uber style guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md) contains a lot of good advice as well.
- Make sure each source file contains the appropriate licence header:

    ```
    Copyright 2021-2025 Zenauth Ltd.
    SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
    ```

- Add tests to cover the functionality you are adding or modifying.
- Add new documentation or update existing content to ensure that the documentation stays consistent with the change you are introducing. See [below](#submitting-pull-requests-for-documentation-changes) for tips on writing documentation.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies if possible. All dependencies must have an appropriate open source licence (Apache-2.0, BSD, MIT).
- Make sure your code is `gofmt`ed. Run `make lint` and fix any warnings produced by the linter.

- Add a changelog entry for your change with the following command:

    ```console
    just changelog-entry <TYPE> <DESCRIPTION>
    ```

   The type of the changelog entry should be one of `breaking`, `chore`, `enhancement`, `feature` or `fix`.
- Sign-off your commits to provide a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org). You can do this by adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command.

    ```sh
    git commit -s -m 'fix: Fix for bug X'
    ```

### Submitting pull requests for documentation changes

- We use [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) to write documentation. Please note that some AsciiDoctor features might not be available in [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/), the static site generation software we use.
- Use simple, [inclusive language](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation). Also refer to the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for general advice on writing good documentation.
- Do not add third-party content in-line without attribution. Use links where possible.
- Ensure that any binary assets (images, videos, etc.) are added to [Git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/tree/main/docs).

- Add a changelog entry for your change with the following command:

    ```console
    just changelog-entry docs <DESCRIPTION>
    ```

- Sign-off your commits to provide a [DCO](https://developercertificate.org). You can do this by adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command.

    ```sh
    git commit -s -m 'bug: Fix for bug X'
    ```

Developing Cerbos
-----------------

Cerbos is developed using the [Go programming language](https://golang.org). Check the `go` directive in the `go.mod` file to find out the minimum version of Go required.

[Just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_4.html) (a better alternative to `make`) is used as the build scripting system and needs to be installed on the system. Other required build tools are automatically downloaded on demand using the versions defined in `tools/go.mod`.

Run `just` to list all available build targets. Some of the frequently used targets are:

- `just tests`: Run all tests.
- `just build`: Compile, test and build the Cerbos binaries and container. Binaries will be output to the `dist` directory. The container name would be `ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:<VERSION>-prerelease`.
- `just pre-commit`: Run tests, lint, and generate code and documentation. Run this before submitting a PR to make sure your code is ready to submit.
- `just dev-server`: Start a Cerbos server. Alternatively, use `just cerbos [ARGS]` or `just cerbosctl [ARGS]` to launch Cerbos or Cerbosctl from source.
- `just docs`: Generate docs and preview in browser.
