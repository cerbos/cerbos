# Cerbos REPL

This program provides an interactive environment to quickly develop CEL conditions to be used in Cerbos policies.
See https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/policies/conditions.html for details of all available CEL functions that
you can try out here.

Type any valid CEL expression at the prompt and hit enter to evaluate it and output the result.

You can also define variables, inspect current state and perform other special operation using directives.
Directives are commands prefixed with a colon (":") character. The following directives are available:

  :h                | Show this help
  :help             | Show this help
  :let              | Define variables
  :q                | Exit the program
  :quit             | Exit the program
  :reset            | Clear all variables
  :vars             | View defined variables
  :load             | Load rules from a policy
  :rules            | View rules loaded from policies
  :exec             | Execute rules loaded from policies

## Evaluating CEL conditions
You can type in any valid CEL expression at the prompt to immediately evaluate it.

  1 + 1             | outputs 2
  "test".charAt(1)  | outputs "e"

The result of evaluating the last expression is stored in the special variable "_".

  1 + 1             | outputs 2 and sets _ to 2 
  _ + 5             | outputs 7 and sets _ to 7


## Define variables
You can define variables using the :let directive. These variables can then be used in subsequent expressions.

  :let x = 12       | declares a variable named x with the value set to 12
  :let y = 1 + 5    | declares a variable named y with the result of evaluating 1 + 5
  x + y             | outputs 18

You can also use the :let directive to set the special Cerbos variables "request", "request.resource", 
"request.principal", "R", "P", "variables" and "V". In these cases, the value must be a valid JSON string.

  :let request = {"principal":{"id":"john","roles":["employee"],"attr":{"scope":"foo.bar.baz.qux"}},"resource":{"id":"x1","kind":"leave_request","attr":{"scope":"foo.bar"}}}

  :let P = {"id":"john","roles":["employee"],"attr":{"scope":"foo.bar.baz.qux"}}


## View variables
You can view the currently defined variables by using the :vars directive.

  :vars             | prints all defined variables


## Load rules from policies
You can load rules from policies using :load directive.

  :load /policies/resource_policies/policy_01.yaml
  :load /policies/derived_roles/derived_01.yaml

## View rules
You can view rules loaded from policies. This command displays the id for the rules, and you can use that later in :exec

  :rules            | prints all rules

## Execute rules

You can execute rules loaded from policies by their id. See :rules for the ids.

  :exec             | execute rules

  :exec #1
  :exec #5

## Clear state
You can destroy all variables and reset the REPL with the :reset directive.

  :reset            | removes all variables and reset the REPL state.


## Exit the REPL

Type :quit, :q or :exit to exit the REPL.
