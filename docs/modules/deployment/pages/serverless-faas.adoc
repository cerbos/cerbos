== AWS Lambda

You can deploy Cerbos to AWS Lambda by building a special container image that includes the Lambda runtime and the Cerbos binary. See https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-aws-lambda for an example. The repository also contains an example of an AWS Lambda function that creates an AWS API Gateway endpoint to communicate with Cerbos over the HTTP protocol.
