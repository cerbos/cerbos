= Cerbos deployment patterns

include::ROOT:partial$version-check.adoc[]


Cerbos can be deployed as a service or as a sidecar. Which mode to choose depends on your requirements.

== Service model

* Central policy decision point shared by a group of applications.
* Cerbos can be upgraded independently from the applications — reducing maintenance overhead.
* In a busy environment, careful capacity planning would be required to ensure that the central Cerbos endpoint does not become a bottleneck.


== Sidecar model

* Each application instance gets its own Cerbos instance — ensuring high performance and availability.
* Upgrades to Cerbos would require a rolling update to all the application instances.
* Policy updates could take slightly longer to propagate to all the individual application instances — resulting in a period where both the old and new policies are in effect at the same time.
