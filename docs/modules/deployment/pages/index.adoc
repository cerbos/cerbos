= Cerbos deployment patterns

include::ROOT:partial$version-check.adoc[]


Cerbos can be deployed as a service or as a sidecar. Which mode to choose depends on your requirements.

== Service model

* Central policy decision point shared by a group of applications.
* Cerbos can be upgraded independently from the applications — reducing maintenance overhead.
* In a busy environment, careful capacity planning would be required to ensure that the central Cerbos endpoint does not become a bottleneck.


== Sidecar model

* Each application instance gets its own Cerbos instance — ensuring high performance and availability.
* Upgrades to Cerbos would require a rolling update to all the application instances.
* Policy updates could take slightly longer to propagate to all the individual application instances — resulting in a period where both the old and new policies are in effect at the same time.

== DaemonSet model

* Each cluster node gets its own Cerbos instance — ensuring high performance and efficient resource usage.
* Policy updates must roll out to nodes individually — resulting in a period where both the old and new policies are in effect at the same time.
* When deployed as a daemonset the service `internalTrafficPolicy` defaults to `Local`. This causes all requests to the service to be forced to the local node for minimum latency. Upgrades to Cerbos could result in application seeing a short outage to the cerbos instance on their own node, client retries may be neccessary. If this is unacceptable you can set `service.internalTrafficPolicy` to `Cluster`. You may be able to improve availability via the `service.kubernetes.io/topology-mode: Auto` annotation.
