= Deploy Cerbos as a sidecar

The sidecar deployment model might be a preferrable option under the following circumstances:

* You have a self-contained application that does not need to share policies with other applications in your environment.
* You prefer to ship policy changes as application updates by bundling the two together.
* You are concerned about network latency.

Cerbos supports serving the API over a Unix domain socket. This allows your application container to securely communicate with the Cerbos service with no network overhead. Because the Cerbos server is only listening over a Unix domain socket, no other applications in your network will be able to communicate with it â€” thus providing secrecy as a bonus side effect.

The following example illustrates a Kubernetes deployment with Cerbos as a sidecar. 

IMPORTANT: We are using link:https://github.com/ghostunnel/ghostunnel[ghostunnel] as the application container for demonstration purposes only. In a real production deployment the Cerbos endpoint should not be exposed to the network.
