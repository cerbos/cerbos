= Storage block

Cerbos supports multiple backends for storing policies. Which storage driver to use is defined by the `driver` setting.

[id="disk-driver"]
== Disk driver

The disk driver is a way to serve the policies from a directory on the filesystem. Any `.yaml`, `.yml` or `.json` files in the directory tree rooted at the given path will be read and parsed as policies.

storage:

.Dynamic fileset with change detection
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
storage:
  driver: disk
  disk:
    directory: /etc/cerbos/policies
    watchForChanges: true
----

CAUTION: On some platforms the automatic change detection feature can be inefficient and resource-intensive if the watched directory contains many files or gets updated frequently.

[id="disk-driver-archives"]
=== Archive Files

Alternatively, you can opt to archive and/or compress your policies directory into a Zip (`.zip`), Tar (`.tar`) or Gzip file (`.tgz` or `.tar.gz`). The archive is assumed to be laid out like a standard policy directory. It must contain no non-policy YAML files.

You specify the file in your config like so:

----
storage:
  driver: disk
  disk:
    directory: /etc/cerbos/policies.zip
----

NOTE: Change detection will be disabled when using archive files.

[id="blob-driver"]
== Blob driver

Cerbos policies can be stored in AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or any other S3-compatible storage systems such as link:https://www.minio.io[Minio].

.Configuration keys
* `bucket`: Required. A URL specifying the service (e.g. S3, GCS), the storage bucket and any other configuration parameters required by the provider.
** AWS S3: `s3://my-bucket?region=us-west-1`. Must specify region in the URL.
** Google Cloud Storage: `gs://my-bucket`
** S3-compatible (e.g. Minio): `s3://my-bucket?endpoint=my.minio.local:8080&disableSSL=true&s3ForcePathStyle=true&region=local`. Must specify region in the URL.
* `prefix`: Optional. Look for policies only under this key prefix.
* `workDir`: Optional. Path to the local directory to download the policies to. Defaults to the system cache directory if not specified.
* `updatePollInterval`: Optional. How frequently the blob store should be checked to discover new or updated policies. Defaults to 0 -- which disables polling.
* `requestTimeout`: Optional. HTTP request timeout. It takes an HTTP request to download a policy file. Defaults to 5s.
* `downloadTimeout`: Optional. Timeout to download all policies from the the storage provider. Must be greater than the `requestTimeout`. Defaults to 60s.

CAUTION: Setting the `updatePollInterval` to a low value could increase resource consumption in both the client and the server systems. Some managed service providers may even impose rate limits or temporary suspensions on your account if the number of requests is too high.


Credentials for accessing the storage buckets are retrieved from the environment. The method of specifying credentials in the environment vary by cloud provider and security configuration. Usually, it involves defining environment variables such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for S3 and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for GCS. Refer to the relevant cloud provider documentation for more details.

[id="git-driver"]
== Git driver

Git is the preferred method of storing Cerbos policies. The server is smart enough to detect when new commits are made to the git repository and refresh its state based on the changes.

NOTE: Azure DevOps repositories use a newer protocol that is currently not supported by the Git library used by Cerbos. We are working to address this issue. In the mean time, please consider using the Cerbos `disk` storage in conjunction with an external Git sync implementation such as https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync or using a CI pipeline to publish your policies to another storage implementation supported by Cerbos.

* Git repositories can be local (`file` protocol) or remote (`ssh` or `https`).
* If no `branch` is specified, the default branch would be the `master` branch.
* If no `subDir` is specified, the entire repository would be scanned for policies (`.yaml`, `.yml` or `.json`).
* The `checkoutDir` is the working directory of the server and must be writable by the server process.
* If `updatePollInterval` is set to 0, the source repository will not be polled to pick up any new commits.
* If `operationTimeout` is not specified, the default timeout for git operations is 60 seconds.

CAUTION: If the git repository is remote, setting the `updatePollInterval` to a low value could increase resource consumption in both the client and the server systems. Some managed service providers may even impose rate limits or temporary suspensions on your account if the number of requests is too high.

[#postgres]
== Postgres Driver

The Postgres storage backend is one of the dynamic stores that supports adding or updating policies at runtime through the xref:server.adoc#admin-api[Admin API].

include::partial$cerbosctl.adoc[]

NOTE: Unlike the SQLite3 driver, the tables and other database objects are not created automatically by the Cerbos Postgres driver. This is to minimize the privileges the Cerbos instance has on the Postgres installation. You must create the required tables using the provided script before configuring Cerbos to connect to the database.

The driver configuration expects the connection details to be provided as connection URL. See link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING[Postgres connstring documentation] for more information. Use the `search_path` parameter to point to the schema containing the Cerbos tables.

You can use environment variable references in the URL to avoid storing credentials as part of the Cerbos configuration file.

[#mysql]
== MySQL Driver

The MySQL storage backend is one of the dynamic stores that supports adding or updating policies at runtime through the xref:server.adoc#admin-api[Admin API].

include::partial$cerbosctl.adoc[]

NOTE: Unlike the SQLite3 driver, the tables and other database objects are not created automatically by the Cerbos MySQL driver. This is to minimize the privileges the Cerbos instance has on the MySQL installation. You must create the required tables using the provided script before configuring Cerbos to connect to the database.

The driver configuration expects the connection details to be provided as a DSN in the following form:

----
[username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]
----

See https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#dsn-data-source-name for the list of supported parameters.

You can use environment variable references in the URL to avoid storing credentials as part of the Cerbos configuration file.
