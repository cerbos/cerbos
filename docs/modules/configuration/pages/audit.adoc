= Audit block

The `audit` block configures the audit logging settings for the Cerbos instance. Audit logs capture access records and decisions made by the engine along with the associated context data.


NOTE: Audit logging has some overhead in terms of resource usage (disk IO, CPU and memory). This overhead is usually negligible unless Cerbos is running in a resource-constrained environment. If resources are scarce or if you are expecting heavy traffic, disabling audit logging might have a positive impact on performance.

.Including or excluding request metadata in log entries
****

To tune how request metadata (headers) is logged to access and decision log entries, configure `includeMetadataKeys` and `excludeMetadataKeys` as follows:

-  Both `includeMetadataKeys` and `excludeMetadataKeys` are empty: no metadata will be logged
- Only `includeMetadataKeys` is defined: only the metadata keys in the list will be logged
- Only `excludeMetadataKeys` is defined: everything except the keys defined in the list will be logged
- Both `includeMetadataKeys` and `excludeMetadataKeys` are defined: Only the keys in the include list will be logged if, and only if, they are not in the exclude list

CAUTION: If requests contain sensitive data such as authorization tokens, they will be captured by the audit logs and visible to anyone with access to the log files. Cerbos automatically excludes the `authorization` header. However, if you use other header keys to store sensitive data, always exclude them using the `excludeMetadataKeys` configuration setting.

== Local backend

The `local` backend uses an embedded key-value store to save audit records. Records are preserved for seven days by default and can be queried using the xref:api:admin_api.adoc[Admin API], the xref:cli:cerbosctl.adoc#audit[`cerbosctl audit`] command or the xref:cli:cerbosctl.adoc#decisions[`cerbosctl decisions`] text interface (TUI).

The only required setting for the `local` backend is the `storagePath` field which specifies the path on disk where the logs should be stored.

audit:
  enabled: true
  accessLogsEnabled: true
  decisionLogsEnabled: true
  backend: local
  local:
    storagePath: /path/to/dir
    retentionPeriod: 168h
    advanced:
      bufferSize: 16 # Size of the memory buffer. Increasing this will use more memory and the chances of losing data during a crash.
      maxBatchSize: 16 # Write batch size. If your records are small, increasing this will reduce disk IO.
      flushInterval: 30s # Time to keep records in memory before committing.
      gcInterval: 15m # How often the garbage collector runs to remove old entries from the log.
----


[#file]
== File backend

The `file` backend writes audit records as newline-delimited JSON to a file or stdout/stderr. With this backend you can use your existing log aggregation system (DataDog agent, Elastic agent, Fluentd, Graylog -- to name a few) to collect, process and archive the audit data from all Cerbos instances.


NOTE: This backend cannot be queried using the Admin API, `cerbosctl audit` or `cerbosctl decisions`.


[source,yaml,linenums]
----
audit:
  enabled: true
  accessLogsEnabled: true
  decisionLogsEnabled: true
  backend: file
  file:
    path: /path/to/audit.log
----


The `path` field can be set to special names `stdout` or `stderr` to log to stdout or stderr. Note that this would result in audit logs being mixed up with normal Cerbos operational logs. It is recommended to use an actual file for audit log output if your container orchestrator has support for collecting logs from files in addition to stdout/stderr.

Audit log entries can be selected by setting a filter on `log.logger == "cerbos.audit"`. Access log entries have `log.kind == "access"` and decision log entries have `log.kind == "decision"`.


[#kafka]
== Kafka backend

The `kafka` backend writes audit records to a Kafka topic. By default, the messages are published asynchronously to the specified topic in JSON format. The message header named `cerbos.audit.kind` would have the value `access` for access log entries and `decision` for decision log entries.

You can configure the audit logger to produce data in the Protocol Buffers binary encoding format as well. The schema for messages is available at https://buf.build/cerbos/cerbos-api/docs/main:cerbos.audit.v1.
