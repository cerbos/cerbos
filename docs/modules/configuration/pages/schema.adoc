= Schema

Cerbos may use user provided schema definition to validate each request made.

== Configuration

`schema` block enables Cerbos to validate request attributes (request.principal.attr and request.resource.attr) by
defining a schema file.

.Schema section
[source,yaml]
----
schema:
  enforcement: reject
----

=== enforcement

Cerbos utilizes the schemas according to the `enforcement` parameter. It has three possible values;

    - none
    - warn
    - reject

==== None

Ignores schemas and does nothing.

==== Warn

Only displays warnings in the server logs.

==== Reject

Responds to the requests with validation errors and also displays them in the server logs.

== Schema file

Cerbos reads the schema from `<STORE>/schemas/schema.yaml`. The schema file may indicate one principal schema definition
and one or more resource schema definition.

The placeholders `<JSON_SCHEMA_DEFINITION>` in the following schema file represents a JSON Schema definition. Please,
see https://json-schema.org/ for more details on what JSON Schema is.

The schema file supports *JSON Schema Draft 04*.
