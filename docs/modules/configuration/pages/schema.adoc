= Schema block

`schema` block enables Cerbos to validate request attributes (request.principal.attr and request.resource.attr) by
defining a schema file.

.Schema section
[source,yaml]
----
schema:
  enforcement: reject
  ignoreExtraFields: false
----

== enforcement

Cerbos will utilize the schemas according to `enforcement` parameter. It has three possible values;

    - none
    - warn
    - reject

=== None

Ignores schemas and does nothing.

=== Warn

Only displays warnings in the server logs.

=== Reject

Responds to the requests with validation errors and also displays them in the server logs.

== ignoreExtraFields

If there are extra fields present in the `.attr` sections of the principal or resource, Cerbos will complain. This
parameter will ignore the extra fields.
