= AuxData block

The `auxData` block configures the auxiliary data sources that can be referenced in policy conditions. 


== JWT

Cerbos supports reading claims from a JWT issued by an authentication system. This helps reduce the boilerplate on the client side to extract the claims from a JWT and add them as attributes to the Cerbos API request. (See xref:api:index.adoc[] and xref:policies:conditions.adoc#auxdata[Auxiliary Data] for more information on how to craft the API request and access the JWT claims in policies.)

In order to verify the JWT, the Cerbos instance must have access to the appropriate keysets. They can be fetched from a URL or read from the local file system.

          url: https://domain.tld/.well-known/keys.jwks
      - id: ks2
        remote: 
          url: https://other-domain.tld/.well-known/keys.jwks
          refreshInterval: 1h # Explicitly set the refresh interval.
      - id: ks3
        local: # Load from a local file
          file: /path/to/keys.jwks
      - id: ks4
        local: # Load from a base64-encoded key data defined inline.
          data: BASE64-ENCODED-KEY-DATA
      - id: ks5
        local:
          file: /path/to/keys.pem
          pem: true # Treat the file (or data) as PEM.
----

IMPORTANT: When multiple keysets are defined in the configuration file, all API requests _must_ include the keyset ID along with the JWT. When only a single keyset is defined in the configuration, then the keyset ID can be dropped from the API requests.


When keysets are fetched from a `remote` source, if the `refreshInterval` is not defined in the configuration, Cerbos will respect the `Cache-Control` and `Expiry` headers returned from the remote source when determining the refresh interval. If none of these data points are available, then the default refresh interval is one hour.

You can disable JWT verification by setting `disableVerification` to `true`.

WARNING: Disabling JWT verification is not recommended because it makes the system insecure by forcing Cerbos to evaluate policies using untrusted data.
