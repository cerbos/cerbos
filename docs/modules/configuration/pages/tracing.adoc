= Tracing block

Cerbos supports distributed tracing to provide insights into application performance and request lifecycle. To enable tracing, set `sampleProbability` to a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Setting the probability to 1.0 makes Cerbos capture tracing information for all requests and setting it to 0.0 disables capturing any traces. 

The system to export the trace data must be specified using the `exporter` setting. Currently only link:https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger] is supported.
