= The Cerbos API

The main API endpoint for making policy decisions is the `/api/check` REST endpoint (`cerbos.svc.v1.CerbosService/CheckResourceSet` RPC in the gRPC API). You can view the latest API documentation from a running Cerbos instance by accessing the root directory of the HTTP endpoint using a browser.

Navigate to link:http://localhost:3592/[] using your browser to explore the Cerbos API documentation.

Alternatively, you can explore the API using the following methods as well:

* Using an OpenAPI-compatible software like link:https://www.postman.com[Postman] or link:https://insomnia.rest[Insomnia] to explore the Cerbos OpenAPI spec available at http://localhost:3592{cerbos-openapi-schema}.
* Using link:https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl] or any other tool that supports link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md[gRPC server reflection] API to explore the gRPC API exposed on port 3593.

----
<1> Filter kind can be `KIND_ALWAYS_ALLOWED`, `KIND_ALWAYS_DENIED` or `KIND_CONDITIONAL`. See below for description of what these values mean.
<2> Populated only if `kind ` is `KIND_CONDITIONAL`. Contains the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the condition that must be satisfied to allow the action.
<3> Condition AST represented as a human readable string. Useful for debugging.

==== Structure of the `filter` block

The `kind` field defines the filter kind.

`KIND_ALWAYS_ALLOWED`:: The principal is unconditionally allowed to perform the action
`KIND_ALWAYS_DENIED`:: The principal is unconditionally not permitted to perfrom the action
`KIND_CONDITIONAL`:: The principal is allowed to perform the action if the condition is satisfied


The `condition` field holds the AST of the condition that must be satisfied. It is rooted in an expression that has an `operator` (e.g. equals, greater than) and `operands` (e.g. a constant value, a variable or another expression).

== Generating API clients

The Cerbos OpenAPI specification can be obtained from a running Cerbos instance by accessing link:http://localhost:3592{cerbos-openapi-schema}[]. Cerbos gRPC API definitions are published to the link:https://buf.build/cerbos/cerbos-api[Buf schema registry (BSR)] and can be easily added to your project if you use the link:https://docs.buf.build[Buf build system for protobufs].

=== REST 

There are many tools available to generate clients from an OpenAPI specification. https://openapi.tools/#sdk is a good resource for finding a tool suitable for your preferred language. 


==== Example: Generating a Java client using OpenAPI Generator

NOTE: link:https://openapi-generator.tech[OpenAPI Generator] has link:https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators#client-generators[support for many popular programming languages and frameworks]. Please consult the documentation to find the client generation instructions for your favourite language.


This is an example of using the popular link:https://openapi-generator.tech[OpenAPI Generator] service to generate a Java client API.

* Download the Cerbos OpenAPI specification
+
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -Lo swagger.json http://localhost:3592{cerbos-openapi-schema}
----
+
* Run the OpenAPI Generator

docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/oas openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i /oas/swagger.json -g java -o /oas/java

=== gRPC

**Any language**

You can access the Cerbos protobuf definitions from the link:https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos/tree/main/api/cerbos[Cerbos source tree]. However, the easiest way to generate client code for your preferred language is to use the link:https://docs.buf.build[Buf build tool] to obtain the published API definitions from the link:https://buf.build/cerbos/cerbos-api[Buf schema registry (BSR)].

* Run `buf export buf.build/cerbos/cerbos-api -o proto` to download the API definitions with dependencies to the `proto` directory.

* You can now use link:https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage[`buf generate`] or `protoc` to generate code using the protobufs available in the `proto` directory.

* If you don't want to download protobufs and then to generate code using `buf` or `protoc`, you can use the link:https://github.com/cerbos/grpc-tools[Cerbos grpc-tools container] to easily generate code for languages like Java, NodeJS, Python, C# etc.



**Go**

The link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cerbos/cerbos/client[Cerbos Go SDK] uses the gRPC API to communicate with Cerbos. The generated gRPC and protobuf code is available under the `github.com/cerbos/cerbos/api/genpb` package.

[source,sh]
----
go get github.com/cerbos/cerbos/api
----

You can also make use of the link:https://docs.buf.build/tour/use-remote-generation[remote generation feature of Buf schema registry] to pull down the Cerbos gRPC API as a Go module:

[source,sh]
----
go get go.buf.build/cerbos/gen-go/cerbos/cerbos-api
