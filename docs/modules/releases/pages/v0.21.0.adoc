[#v0.21.0]
= Cerbos v0.21.0

== Highlights

Advanced server tuning knobs are now available to help users who have special deployment requirements. Most users won't need to adjust these as the built-in defaults are suitable for most common deployment scenarios.

Users now have more control over which request metadata keys are logged to the request logs produced by the Audit logging system. Keys can be included or excluded based on your requirements. The default behaviour is to not log anything.

This release includes fixes to two edge cases found in the query planner:

- Handle the case when all expressions in an `any` block evaluates to `false`
- Gracefully handle self-referential lambda expressions with unknown values

When the Admin API is used to reload a store, it now automatically purges the compile cache.

The Go SDK client was previously restricted to local connections when TLS was disabled. Now it can connect to any host even when TLS is disabled.
