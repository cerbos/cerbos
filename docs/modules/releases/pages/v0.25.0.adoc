[#v0.25.0]
= Cerbos v0.25.0

This release contains improvements to the Admin API to make administrative tasks easier and error-free.

== Highlights

When using database-backed policy stores, it's now possible to disable policies by name xref:cli:cerbosctl.adoc#disable[using `cerbosctl`] or the xref:api:admin_api.adoc#disable-policies[Admin API]. Previously this required re-submitting the whole policy to the Admin API with its `disabled` field set to `true`. The new endpoint detects whether disabling a scoped policy would break the scope chain and warns the user about it. That helps prevent users from making changes that leaves the policy store in an invalid state.

The `DeleteSchema` Admin API endpoint now returns the number of schemas deleted and does not throw an error if none were deleted.

This release includes a bug fix for the situation whereby if a user edited a policy in-place while Cerbos was running and changed its identifiers (kind, name, version), the old policy definition would still be available in the compiled policy cache and can be used for making decisions. Now Cerbos detects when a policy file has changed its identifiers and evicts the old state from the cache.
