[#v0.40.0]
= Cerbos v0.40.0

== Highlights

xref:policies:variables.adoc#constants[Constants] are a new way of defining structured, constant values that can be referenced in policy conditions. They differ from xref:policies:variables.adoc#variables[Variables] in two ways:

- They must be static constant values. Dynamic values calculated using CEL expressions are not allowed.
- They can be defined with YAML primitives such as lists, maps, numbers, strings etc. Variables, on the other hand, always have to be defined as strings -- which make them awkward for defining lists or maps.

This release includes several enhancements to the policy testing framework to help reduce repetition, increase readability and increase reliability.

Multiple principals and/or resources can be referenced in a test expectation instead of just a single principal and a resource. This helps get rid of repetition and reduces the verbosity of test cases.

Test fixtures now allow creating groups of principals or resources. These grouped principals or resources can be referenced by their group name in the test cases to further avoid duplication and make tests more readable.

Tests that exercise policies with time-based conditions must define the value of `now` at the test suite level or at individual test case level. This ensures that tests are not flaky depending on the time of day the tests are run.

This is the last Cerbos release with support for SQL Server as a policy storage backend. It will be removed in the next release of Cerbos. This is due to low uptake and the lack of resources and expertise to maintain and support it going forward.

This release also includes several updates related to the experimental role policy feature. That feature is still at alpha level and is not recommended for production use.
