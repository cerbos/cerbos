[#v0.19.0]
= Cerbos v0.19.0

== Highlights

The `PlanResources` API now validates requests using xref:configuration:schema.adoc[schema enforcement level] defined in the configuration file determines whether invalid requests are processed with warnings or completely rejected.

This release also includes several fixes to the `PlanResources` output to simplify the plan produced for expressions that make use of higher-order functions like `in` and `exists`. The AST produced for logical operators like `and` and `or` is now more consistent regardless of the operator used as well.

Distributed traces can now be exported to collectors that support link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md[OTLP] by using the new xref:rcrowe for contributing this feature.
