[#v0.20.0]
= Cerbos v0.20.0

== Highlights

Writing policy tests for policies that have time-based conditions is now easier because the value returned by the `now` function can be fixed for the entire test suite or individual tests. This also influences the `timeSince` calculations and gives you the ability to write deterministic tests to ensure that your logic is sound. See xref:policies:compile.adoc#testing[the policy testing documentation] to learn more.

.Examples
[%collapsible]
====

.Setting the value of `now` for the entire test suite
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
name: TestSuite
description: Tests for verifying something
options:
  now: "2022-08-02T15:00:00Z"
tests:
...
----

.Setting the value of `now` for a single test
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
tests:
  - name: With local now
    options:
      now: "2022-08-03T15:00:00Z"
    ...
----

====

The security warnings for default Admin API credentials are now smarter.

An overly strict validation rule that prevented single wildcards from being used for resource names in principal policies has been relaxed.
