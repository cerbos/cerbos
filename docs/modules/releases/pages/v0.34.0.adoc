[#v0.34.0]
= Cerbos v0.34.0

== Highlights

In this release, we have reworked the internals of Cerbos to significantly improve the syntax error messages with better descriptions, precise locations, and contextual information.Based on frequently asked support questions, the policy parser has been made smarter to detect common policy authoring mistakes and warn users about them as well. These usability enhancements are targeted at making the output of `cerbos compile` easier to understand and help you debug policy syntax issues quicker.

Thanks to Cerbos community member @psolarcz, all Cerbos release artifacts are now signed and can be verified using link:https://www.sigstore.dev[sigstore] tools. Previously, only the container images were signed.
