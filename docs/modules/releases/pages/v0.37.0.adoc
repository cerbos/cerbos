[#v0.37.0]
= Cerbos v0.37.0

== Highlights

The xref:cli:cerbos.adoc#repl[Cerbos REPL] now provides auto-completion for built-in commands and files to make it even easier to use as a development and debugging tool for Cerbos policies.

In addition to variables, the `InspectPolicies` Admin API response now also includes the derived roles that are referenced in each inspected policy. It also supports restricting the results to one or more policies using their IDs. This enables users to easily target a set of known policies and obtain information about them, which is a common requirement when building custom user interfaces on top of Cerbos.

Kubernetes users can now xref:deployment:index.adoc#daemonset[deploy Cerbos as a DaemonSet] using the official Helm chart. Compared to the sidecar model, a DaemonSet deployment would use fewer resources on each node while still providing node-local network connectivity.

The `cerbos compile` command provides better context information about YAML syntax errors in policies and the `cerbosctl inspect` command can now produce output in machine-readable formats as well.

Based on user feedback, some Admin API restrictions -- such as the limit on number of policies that can be updated in a single `AddOrUpdatePolicy` request -- have been relaxed in this release.
