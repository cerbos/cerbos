[#v0.35.1]
= Cerbos v0.35.1

== Highlights

This is a bug-fix release to handle a cache invalidation bug with lenient scope search and a common expression that should be simplified by the query planner.

This release also includes a new work-in-progress Admin API endpoint to inspect the policies in the policy repo and list their properties. Currently it supports listing the actions covered by each policy.
