[#v0.13.0]
= Cerbos v0.13.0

IMPORTANT: This release requires existing MySQL or Postgres users to perform a migration step before upgrading. More information can be found in the xref:v0.13.0/migration.adoc[migration documentation].

== Highlights

This release introduces the concept of xref:0.13.0@policies:scoped_policies.adoc[scoped policies] to address the common usecase of modelling hierarchical relationships. The new `scope` field of resource and principal policies allows you to define a dot-separated string describing their position in the hierarchy. At runtime, based on the scope defined by the API request, the Cerbos engine moves upwards through the set of policies in the hierarchy until one of them produces a decision. With this feature you can define a base set of access policies that can then be overridden for particular departments, tenants or any other unit of access control that makes sense for your application.

Another new feature in this release is the introduction of the `cerbos run` command. This command can be used as a test runner or even as a quick way to try out Cerbos. It launches a Cerbos instance in the background (loading any policies found in the `policies` directory) and then runs the user-provided command. Two environment variables named `CERBOS_HTTP` and `CERBOS_GRPC` are injected to the environment of the child process so that it can discover the Cerbos PDP.  When the child process exits, the Cerbos instance is automatically shutdown as well. For more information, see the xref:0.13.0@cli:cerbos.adoc#run[`cerbos run` documentation]. 

This release also adds support for using xref:0.13.0@configuration:storage.adoc#sqlserver[Microsoft SQL Server as a storage backend].
