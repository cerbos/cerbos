[#v0.38.1]
= Cerbos v0.38.1

== Highlights

The `hub` storage driver can now be configured to connect to any private playground hosted on link:https://www.cerbos.dev/product-cerbos-hub[Cerbos Hub]. This allows individuals and teams to use the IDE-like functionality of the playgrounds to quickly build authorization prototypes and test them end-to-end without worrying about deploying infrastructure first.

The policy version and scope of the resource and principal are now available for use in policy conditions through `request.resource.policyVersion`, `request.resource.scope`, `request.principal.policyVersion` and `request.principal.scope`.

The `cerbos compile` command now produces better error messages to help track down issues with missing scope policies.

In addition to signing the Cerbos release binaries and containers using link:https://www.sigstore.dev[Sigstore infrastructure], the release process now produces SBOMs to help trace the provenance of each Cerbos release.

The response from the `InspectPolicies` Admin API endpoint now includes principal and resource attributes referenced by the inspected policies. Note that this currently only an API update. The SDKs and `cerbosctl` updates to interact with the API will follow soon.

The official Cerbos Helm chart now includes a `values.schema.json` file to help link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files[discover any configuration problems].

The documentation now includes a xref:api:attachment$cerbos-api.html[static version of the Cerbos OpenAPI specification,window=_blank]. For the interactive version, launch a Cerbos PDP and navigate to http://localhost:3592.
