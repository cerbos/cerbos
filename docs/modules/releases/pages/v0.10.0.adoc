[#v0.10.0]
= Cerbos v0.10.0

== Highlights

This release is about making Cerbos easier to install and try out. In addition to the existing container images, binaries and Helm charts, Cerbos can now be installed using xref:0.10.0@ROOT:installation/binary.adoc#homebrew[Homebrew] and xref:0.10.0@ROOT:installation/binary.adoc#linux-packages[DEB or RPM packages] as well. We have also added documentation and recipes for running Cerbos on the xref:0.10.0@deployment:serverless-faas.adoc[AWS Lambda platform] and as a xref:0.10.0@deployment:systemd.adoc[Systemd service] on Linux.
