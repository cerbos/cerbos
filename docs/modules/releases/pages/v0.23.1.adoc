[#v0.23.1]
= Cerbos v0.23.1

This is a patch release to fix a bug discovered since the release of xref:v0.23.0.adoc[version 0.23.0].

== Highlights

This patch release fixes a bug where the query planner fails to produce a plan when an expression references non-attribute fields of the resource such as `R.id`.

The Helm chart now supports user-defined annotations to be added to the `Deployment` and `Service` resources. This is useful for integrating with annotation-driven Kubernetes tools and utilities such as the Jaeger operator.
