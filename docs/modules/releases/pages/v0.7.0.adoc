[#v0.7.0]
= Cerbos v0.7.0

== Highlights

Improved policy testing framework:: In this release we have overhauled the policy testing framework to make it more ergonomic. Reusable test fixtures can be defined inline in a test suite or in a dedicated `testdata` directory to be shared between different suites. This is one of the rare occasions in which we have decided to introduce a breaking change because it adds enough value to justify it. You will need to make minor changes to existing test suites to make them work with this release. See xref:0.7.0@cerbos:policies:compile.adoc[] for more details.
New set functions:: You can perform set intersection (`intersect`, `has_intersection`) and check for subsets (`is_subset`) in policy condition blocks using the new functions introduced in this release. 
Strict configuration:: To help catch typos and other potential sources of misconfiguration, Cerbos configuration is now parsed much more strictly. Unknown configuration keys will prevent the Cerbos server from starting up.
Admin API improvements:: Preliminary support for listing policies has been added to the Admin API. This an area of active development and further improvements such as filtering, sorting and pagination will be added in future releases.
