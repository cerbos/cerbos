[#v0.23.0]
= Cerbos v0.23.0

This is a quick release containing some usability improvements and fixes to bugs discovered since the xref:v0.22.0.adoc[release of v0.22.0].

== Highlights

The Cerbos CLI (`cerbosctl`) now supports using zip files for loading policies and schemas through the Admin API. This streamlines the process of exporting policies and schemas from the link:https://play.cerbos.dev[Cerbos Playground] into your own Cerbos instance.

It is now possible to set scopes for `PlanResources` requests made through the Go SDK. We have also re-written some code that accidentally relied on Go 1.19 features so that the SDK remains usable for users who have not yet upgraded to Go 1.19.

The generated query plan for certain indexing expressions is now much simpler. A query plan bug that manifested when known values were used to index into unknown containers has also been fixed.

The error message produced when users try to use the audit log while it's not enabled is now more informative.
