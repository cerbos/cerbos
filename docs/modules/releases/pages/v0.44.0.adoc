[#v0.44.0]
= Cerbos v0.44.0

== Highlights

The `PlanResources` API call now supports specifying more than one action. The generated plan contains the set of constraints that need to be satisfied in order for all of the given actions to be allowed. This can be useful for reducing the number of API calls and the client-side merging required in certain scenarios. The singular `action` field of the `PlanResources` API call is now deprecated and will be removed in a future Cerbos release.

The meaning of `storage.<database driver>.connRetry.maxAttempts` has slightly changed in this release. Previously, it was interpreted as the maximum number of retries after the initial connection attempt. Now it refers to the total number of connection attempts including the initial one. We don't expect this to be an issue for most users. If you relied on a particular behaviour based on this value, increment the previous configuration value by one when you upgrade to Cerbos 0.44.0.

This release includes several improvements and bug fixes that aren't directly visible to end users such as the continuation of the engine overhaul that was started several releases ago and improvements to query plan output to produce more succinct plans. There are new utilities and bug fixes for link:https://www.cerbos.dev/product-cerbos-hub[Cerbos Hub] integrations as well.
