[#v0.32.0]
= Cerbos v0.32.0

== Highlights

This release includes a major update to the Cerbos internals to fully migrate from OpenCensus to OpenTelemetry for distributed traces and metrics. Migrating to OpenTelemetry gives users the ability to use push metrics, fine tune trace sampling, and integrate Cerbos with the wider ecosystem of link:https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/[observability products that support the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP)]. As part of this migration, configuring traces using the `tracing` block of Cerbos configuration file is now deprecated and we advise users to xref:configuration:tracing.adoc#migration[migrate existing configuration] to use the xref:configuration:observability.adoc[well-known OpenTelemetry environment variables] instead. Support for the Jaeger native protocol has been deprecated as well in favour of OTLP and it will be removed in the next release of Cerbos along with support for trace configuration via the `tracing` configuration block.

While we have strived to keep all metric names unchanged, some subtle differences between OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry instruments might have an impact on your existing dashboards and metric-based alerts. Please review your dashboards and metric-based alerts after the upgrade to make sure they are still functioning as expected.

The policy test framework now includes support for defining the contents of xref:configuration:engine.adoc#globals[`globals`] per test case or for the whole test suite.

When running tests with the `--verbose` flag, the result output will now include the expected effects and policy outputs for successful test cases as well.
