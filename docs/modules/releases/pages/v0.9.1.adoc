[#v0.9.1]
= Cerbos v0.9.1

This is a quick patch release to fix an issue that was discovered in config parsing. The `bcrypt` hashes of admin API credentials can contain `$` characters which cause the config loader to treat the subsequent set of characters as the name of an environment variable. We now require the `passwordHash` to be a bcrypt hash that has been base64 encoded. Please note that this is a breaking change. If you have a config file with `server.adminAPI.adminCredentials.passwordHash` set, encode it with base64 to work with this version of Cerbos. 


== Highlights 

If you have policy tests intermingled with your policies, the `cerbos compile` command will now automatically run those tests. Use the `--skip-tests` flag to switch off this behaviour.
