[#v0.30.0]
= Cerbos v0.30.0

This release contains many enhancements, features and bug fixes to the Cerbos core engine, policy development tools and deployment methods.

== Highlights

xref:policies:variables.adoc[Variables] used in policies are now checked at compile time to detect unknown variables and circular references. This change helps policy authors detect problems with policies early on during development time and enables the Cerbos engine to perform runtime optimizations as well. Please note that if your existing policies reference undefined variables, this version of Cerbos will refuse to start until those issues are rectified. Before upgrading your Cerbos services or sidecars to v0.30.0, we recommend running the xref:policies:compile.adoc[`cerbos compile`] command on your policy repository to detect and fix the new compile errors.

Cerbos now follows the convention of looking for `.cerbos.yaml` as the default configuration file. This is to support the common use case of including the Cerbos configuration within the policy repo itself. If you use xref:cli:cerbos.adoc#run[`cerbos run`], you may need to rename your configuration file to `.cerbos.yaml`.

The `file` audit log driver now supports automatic log rotation based on file size and age. It also gains the ability to output to multiple destinations (`tee`) such as a file and `stdout`/`stderr` at the same time.

Cerbos can now be configured with an acceptable skew value for validating the standard JWT time-based claims (`exp` and `nbf`).

Using the new xref:cli:cerbosctl.adoc#export[`cerbosctl store export`] command, you can export your policy repository to a directory or zip/tar.gz archive. This is particularly useful when working with database stores to help troubleshoot issues using Cerbos developer tools such as the test runner and the REPL. It can also be used as a backup tool for capturing snapshots of your policy repo.

The `cerbos compile` command can now work with policies stored in zip/tar.gz archives. This complements the ability of Cerbos `disk` driver to work with archive files.
