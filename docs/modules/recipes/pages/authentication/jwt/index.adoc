= Tutorial: Using Cerbos with JWT


An example application of integrating https://cerbos.dev[Cerbos] with an
https://expressjs.com/[Express] server using https://jwt.io/[JSON Web
Tokens] - via https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt[express-jwt] - for
authentication.

== Dependencies

* Node.js
* Docker for running the xref:ROOT:installation/container.adoc[Cerbos Policy Decision Point (PDP)]

== Getting Started

. Clone the repo
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:cerbos/express-jwt-cerbos.git
----

. Start up the Cerbos PDP instance docker container. This will be called
by the express app to check authorization.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd cerbos
./start.sh
----

. Install node dependencies
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

. Start the express server
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run start
----

== Policies

This example has a simple CRUD policy in place for a resource kind of
`contact` - like a CRM system would have. The policy file can be found
in the `cerbos/policies` folder
https://github.com/cerbos/express-jwt-cerbos/blob/main/cerbos/policies/contact.yaml[here].

Should you wish to experiment with this policy, you can try it in the
https://play.cerbos.dev/p/sZC611cf06deexP0q8CTcVufTVau1SA3[Cerbos Playground].

The policy expects one of two roles to be set on the principal - `admin`
and `user`. These roles are authorized as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Action |User |Admin
|list |Y |Y
|read |Y |Y
|create |N |Y
|update |N |Y
|delete |N |Y
|===

This business logic is represented in Cerbos as a resource policy.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: default
  resource: contact
  rules:
  - actions: ["read", "list"]
    roles:
      - admin
      - user
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW

  - actions: ["create", "update", "delete"]
    roles:
      - admin
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
----

== JWT Structure

For this example a JWT needs to be generated to be passed in the
authorization header. The payload of the token contains an array of
roles which are passed into Cerbos to use for authorization - the
structure is as follows:

....
{
  sub: string,
  name: string,
  iat: number,
  roles: string[] // "user" and "admin" supported in this demo
}
....

https://jwt.io[JWT.io] can be used generate a token for testing purposes
- an
https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiYWRtaW4iXSwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.CQEEaSdswE2tou7MUeSe4-6kfe1imJXnbqhiMFsF13A[example
is here].

*Note:* The secret is hardcoded in this example to `yoursecret` and the
algorithm is `HS256` - you will need to set these for the signature to
be valid.

== Request Flow

. HTTP request comes in and the `express-jwt` library validates the
token and adds the payload to `req.user`.
. The contents of the JWT token is mapped to the structure of the
principal object required by Cerbos

[source,js]
----
// Extract data from the JWT (check DB etc) and create the principal object to be sent to Cerbos
const jwtToPrincipal = ({ sub, iat, roles = [], ...rest }) => {
  return {
    id: sub,
    roles,
    attr: rest,
  };
};
----

[start=3]
. Fetch the data required about the resource being accessed from the
data store
. Call the Cerbos PDP with the principal, resource and action to check
the authorization and then return an error if the user is not
authorized. The https://www.npmjs.com/package/cerbos[Cerbos package] is
used for this.

[source,js]
----
const allowed = await cerbos.check({
  principal: jwtToPrincipal(req.user),
  resource: {
    kind: "contact",
    instances: {
      //a map of the resource(s) being accessed
      [contact.id]: {
        attr: contact,
      },
    },
  },
  actions: ["read"], //the list of actions being performed
});

// not authorized for read action
if (!allowed.isAuthorized(contact.id, "read")) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
}

[start=5]
. Serve the response if authorized

== Example Requests

Once a JWT token has been generated requests can be made to the express
server.

=== List contacts

Allowed for `user` and `admin` roles

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/contacts' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token here>'
----

=== Get a contact

Allowed for `user` and `admin` roles

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/contacts/abc123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token here>'
----

=== Create a contact

Allowed for `admin` role only

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/contacts/new' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token here>'
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["admin"]` the
response will be"

[source,json]
----
{ "result": "Created contact" }
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["user"]` the
response will be:

[source,json]
----
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
----

=== Update a contact

Allowed for `admin` role only

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/contacts/abc123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token here>'
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["admin"]` the
response will be"

[source,json]
----
{ "result": "Contact updated" }
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["user"]` the
response will be:

[source,json]
----
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
----

=== Delete a contact

Allowed for `admin` role only

[source,bash]
----
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:3000/contacts/abc123' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token here>'
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["admin"]` the
response will be"

[source,json]
----
{ "result": "Contact deleted" }
----

Should this request be made with the JWT roles set to `["user"]` the
response will be:

[source,json]
----
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
----
