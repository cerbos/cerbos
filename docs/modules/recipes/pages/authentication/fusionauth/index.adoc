An example stack of integrating https://cerbos.dev[Cerbos] with an https://expressjs.com/[Express] server using https://fusionauth.com/[FusionAuth] for authentication.

This example is based off the https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-node[FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-node] repo.

== Dependencies

* docker-compose

== Getting Started

. Clone the repo
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:cerbos/express-fusionauth-cerbos.git
----

=== Start Stack

Start up the stack `docker compose up` - this will take some time to
pull down all the images and launch them, but once started the following
services will be running.

* FusionAuth http://localhost:9011[`http://localhost:9011`]
* Cerbos http://localhost:3592/[`http://localhost:3592/`]
* Node App http://localhost:8080/[`http://localhost:8080/`]
* Postgres DB for FustionAuth on port `5432`

=== Configure FusionAuth

This example is based off the
https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/[FusionAuth 5
Minute Guide] - and most of the steps have bee handled by the
`docker compose` setup.

The only manual steps required are creating the application. To do this,
open up http://localhost:9011[`http://localhost:9011`] and complete the
setup wizard, then:

Once we arrive in the FusionAuth admin UI, the first thing we need to do
is create an Application. An Application is something that a user can
log into. This is the application we are building or that we are
migrating to use FusionAuth. We'll click the Application menu option on
the left side of the page or the Setup button in the box at the top of
the page.

This will take us to the listing page for Applications. Next, we'll
click the green plus button (the add button) at the top of the page:

image:fusionauth-application-listing.png[role="center-img"]

On the Application form, we'll need to provide a name for our
Application (only used for display purposes) and a couple of items on
the OAuth tab. We'll start with a simple setup that allows existing
users to log into your application. Therefore, we won't need to define
any roles or registration configuration. If we click on the OAuth tab,
we'll see these options:

Most of the defaults will work, but we also need to provide these items:

* An authorized redirect URL. This is the route/controller in our
application's backend that will complete the OAuth workflow. This is
also known as the 'Backend for Frontend' or BFF pattern, and is a
lightweight proxy. In our example, we set this to
`http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`. We'll show some Node.js example
code below for this route.
* Optionally, we can specify a valid Logout URL. This is where the user
will be redirected to after they are logged out of FusionAuth's OAuth
front-end: our application.
* We need to ensure that the Authorization Code grant is selected in the
Enabled Grants.

Next we need to add the roles that will be used by our policies. Back on
the application listing page press the 'Manage Roles' button next to our
application and add roles for `user` and `editor` (admin should already
exist). These roles will be passed back with the user information to our
application, and then passed onto Cerbos for use in authorization
decisions.

Once we have all of this configured, we can then copy the Client ID and
Client Secret and move to the next step.

=== Configure Node App

Now that our application has been created, we need to add the Client ID
and Client Secret from FusionAuth into the top of `app/index.js` (line
12 & 13). These will be used to identify the app through the login flow.

=== Test the app

Now that everything is wired up you should be able to goto
http://localhost:8080[`http://localhost:8080`] and press the login link
to authenticate with your FusionAuth account.

== Policies

This example has a simple CRUD policy in place for a resource kind of
`contact` - like a CRM system would have. The policy file can be found
in the `cerbos/policies` folder
https://github.com/cerbos/express-fusionauth-cerbos/blob/main/cerbos/policies/contact.yaml[here].

Should you wish to experiment with this policy, you can try it in the
https://play.cerbos.dev/p/g561543292ospj7w0zOrFx7H5DzhmLu2[Cerbos Playground].

The policy expects one of two roles to be set on the principal - `admin`
and `user`. These roles are authorized as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Action |User |Admin
|list |Y |Y
|read |Y |Y
|create |Y |Y
|update |If owner |Y
|delete |If owner |Y
|===

== Request Flow

. User access the application and clicks `Login`
. User is directed to the FusionAuth UI and authenticates
. A token is returned back in the redirect URL to the application
. That token is then exchanged for the user profile information
. The user profile from FusionAuth being stored (user Id, email, roles
etc).
. Any requests to the `/contacts` endpoints fetch the data required
about the resource being accessed from the data store
. Call the Cerbos PDP with the principal, resource and action to check
the authorization and then return an error if the user is not
authorized. The https://www.npmjs.com/package/cerbos[Cerbos package] is
used for this.
[source,javascript]
---
const allowed = await cerbos.check({
  principal: { //pass in the Okta user ID and groups
    id: req.userContext.userinfo.sub,
    roles: req.userContext.userinfo.groups,
  },
  resource: {
    kind: "contact",
    instances: {
      //a map of the resource(s) being accessed
      [contact.id]: {
        attr: contact,
      },
    },
  },
  actions: ["read"], //the list of actions being performed
});

// not authorized for read action
if (!allowed.isAuthorized(contact.id, "read")) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
}
---
Implementation at this stage will be dependant on your business requirements.
