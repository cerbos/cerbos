An example application of integrating https://cerbos.dev[Cerbos] with an https://expressjs.com/[Express] server using https://okta.com/[Okta] for authentication.

== Dependencies

* Node.js
* An https://okta.com/[Okta] account

---
For simplicity this demo is using the hosted Cerbos Demo PDP avaliable in the Playground so running the Cerbos container locally isn't required. For production use cases a deployed Cerbos PDP is required and the code updated to point to your instance. You can read more about the deployment options https://docs.cerbos.dev/cerbos/latest/deployment/index.html[here].
---

== Setup

=== Install Deps

. Clone the repo
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:cerbos/express-okta-cerbos.git
----

=== Create an Okta Application

In your Okta instance you need to create a new application. For this
example we will be making use of Okta's ExpressOIDC package so the
application's sign-in method needs to be `OIDC - OpenID Connect` and the
application type is `Web Application`.

=== Set Redirect URLs

The default redirect URLs for sign-in and sign-out are correct if you
are running this demo app on the default 8080 port. If you have chanaged
this in your `.env` file then you will need to update accordingly.

=== Enabling Groups in the Okta Token

By default the groups the user belongs to are not passed to the
application in the Okta token - this needs enabling as these groups will
be passed from Okta to Cerbos for use in authorization decisions.

To do this, goto _Security > API_ in the sidebar, and edit the default
_Authorization Server_.

On this page, got the _Claims_ tab and press _Add Claim_. Add a new
claim called groups which includes the groups of the user in the ID
token.

____
In production you will likely want to filter this down, but for this
example we are enabling all groups to be added to the token.
____


=== Create an example `admin` group.

In a new Okta account the only group that exists is the _Everyone_
group. For our demo application policies we expect users to be in
`admin` or `user` group as this is what is checked.

Under _Directory > Groups_ press _Add Group_ and create the two groups
and add your example users to them.

=== Setup Environment Variables

Make a copy of the `.env.sample` file and call it `.env`. You will then
need to populate the feilds that begin with `OKTA_` with the information
provided in the new application you created.

....
PORT=8080
CERBOS_HOSTNAME=https://demo-pdp.cerbos.cloud
CERBOS_PLAYGROUND=ygW612cc9c9xXOsOZjI40ovY2LZvXf43
OKTA_DOMAIN=
OKTA_CLIENTID=
OKTA_CLIENTSECRET=
OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
....

____
This example is using the hosted Demo PDP of Cerbos and an example
Playground instance. If you are running your own Cerbos PDP then update
the `CERBOS_HOSTNAME` feild to your own instance and remove the
`CERBOS_PLAYGROUND` feild.
____

=== Test the app

Now that everything is wired up you should be able to goto
http://localhost:8080[`http://localhost:8080`] and press the login link
to authenticate with your Okta account.

== Policies

This example has a simple CRUD policy in place for a resource kind of
`contact` - like a CRM system would have. Should you wish to experiment with this policy, you can try it in the
https://play.cerbos.dev/p/g561543292ospj7w0zOrFx7H5DzhmLu2[Cerbos Playground].

The policy expects one of two roles to be set on the principal - `admin`
and `user`. These roles are authorized as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Action |User |Admin
|list |Y |Y
|read |Y |Y
|create |N |Y
|update |N |Y
|delete |N |Y
|===

== Request Flow

. User access the application and clicks Login
. User is directed to the Okta UI and authenticates
. A token is returned back in the redirect URL to the application
. That token is then exchanged for the user profile information
. The user profile from Okta being stored (user Id, roles etc).
. Any requests to the /contacts endpoints fetch the data required about the resource being accessed from the data store
. Call the Cerbos PDP with the principal, resource and action to check the authorization and then return an error if the user is not authorized. The Cerbos package is used for this.
[source,javascript]
---
const allowed = await cerbos.check({
  principal: { //pass in the Okta user ID and groups
    id: req.userContext.userinfo.sub,
    roles: req.userContext.userinfo.groups,
  },
  resource: {
    kind: "contact",
    instances: {
      //a map of the resource(s) being accessed
      [contact.id]: {
        attr: contact,
      },
    },
  },
  actions: ["read"], //the list of actions being performed
});

// not authorized for read action
if (!allowed.isAuthorized(contact.id, "read")) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
}
---
Implementation at this stage will be dependant on your business requirements.
