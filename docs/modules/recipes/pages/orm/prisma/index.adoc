= Tutorial: Using Cerbos with Prisma
:page-aliases: tutorials:orm/prisma/index.adoc

https://prisma.io[Prisma] has come onto the Node/Typescript scene recently as a new generation of ORM. With itâ€™s strongly-typed client, schema abstraction and great documentation, it is turning into the natural choice for modern applications.

This article covers setting up a basic CRM web application using Prisma for data storage and Cerbos for authorization to create, read, update and delete contacts based on who the user is. Our business requirements for who can do what are as follows:

* Admins can do all actions
* Users in the Sales department can read and create contacts
* Only the user who created the contact can update and delete it

The last point is an important one as the authorization decision requires context of what is being accessed to make the decision if an action can be performed.

Note that whilst authentication is out of scope of this article, Cerbos is compatible with any authentication system - be it basic auth, JWT or a service like https://auth0.com[Auth0].

You can find the Github repo for this tutorial  https://github.com/cerbos/express-prisma-cerbos/[here].

=== Setting up Prisma

To get started, we need to install our various dependencies. Copy and run the following:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir express-prisma-cerbos
cd express-prisma-cerbos

cat << EOF > package.json
{
  "prisma": {
      "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  }
}
EOF

npm i express @cerbos/grpc @prisma/client &&
npm i --save-dev @types/express ts-node
----

For this simplified tutorial, we will use a simple Prisma model to represent a CRM contact. We'll also opt to use a SQLite database, but this can be swapped out to your DB of choice. You can find the Prisma documentation https://www.prisma.io/docs/[here] for more details.

Create a `prisma` folder and add the basic Prisma schema to `prisma/schema.prisma`, by copying and running the following:

[source]
----
mkdir prisma && cat << EOF > prisma/schema.prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = "file:./dev.db"
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Contact {
  id             String   @id @default(cuid())
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
  firstName      String
  lastName       String
  ownerId        String
  active         Boolean  @default(false)
  marketingOptIn Boolean  @default(false)
}
EOF
----

Next, we define the seed script which will be used to populate the database with the following contacts:

[cols="2,1,1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| ID | First Name | Marketing Opt-In | Active | Owner ID

| 1 | Nick | Yes | Yes | 1
| 2 | Simon | Yes | No | 1
| 3 | Mary | No | Yes | 1
| 4 | Christina | Yes | No | 2
| 5 | Aleks | Yes | Yes | 2
|===

Run the following to generate the script:

[source,bash]
----
cat << EOF > prisma/seed.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const contactData = [
  {
    id: "1",
    firstName: "Nick",
    lastName: "Smyth",
    marketingOptIn: true,
    active: true,
    ownerId: "1",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    firstName: "Simon",
    lastName: "Jaff",
    marketingOptIn: true,
    active: false,
    ownerId: "1",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    firstName: "Mary",
    lastName: "Jane",
    active: true,
    marketingOptIn: false,
    ownerId: "1",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    firstName: "Christina",
    lastName: "Baker",
    marketingOptIn: true,
    active: false,
    ownerId: "2",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    firstName: "Aleks",
    lastName: "Kozlov",
    marketingOptIn: true,
    active: true,
    ownerId: "2",
  }
];

async function main() {
  console.log("Start seeding ...");
  for (const c of contactData) {
    const contact = await prisma.contact.create({
      data: c,
    });
    console.log("Created contact with id: " + contact.id);
  }
  console.log("Seeding finished.");
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.\$disconnect();
  });
EOF
----

Now, to initialize our DB, generate the Prisma client and seed the database, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
----

=== Creating an access policy

NOTE: We will be using a Docker container to run the Cerbos PDP instance, so ensure that you have https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker] set up first!

The first step is to create a resource policy file. Our requirements, as a reminder, were:

* Admins can do all actions
* Users in the Sales department can read and create contacts
* Only the user who created the contact can update and delete it
* A resource policy file called â€˜contacts.yamlâ€™ should be created in the policies folder with the following:

Let's create a `cerbos` directory (https://github.com/cerbos/express-prisma-cerbos/tree/main/cerbos[see repo]) with a subdirectory; `policies`, and a file `contacts.yaml` inside there. To do this, run the following:

[source,yaml]
----
mkdir -p cerbos/policies && cat << EOF > cerbos/policies/contacts.yaml
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: default
  resource: contact
  rules:
  # Admins can do all actions
  - actions: ["*"]
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
    roles:
      - admin    

  # Users in the Sales department can read and create contacts
  - actions: ["read", "create"]
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
    roles:
      - user
    condition:
      match:
        expr: request.principal.attr.department == "Sales"

  # Only the user who created the contact can update and delete it
  - actions: ["update", "delete"]
    effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
    roles:
      - user
    condition:
      match:
        expr: request.resource.attr.ownerId == request.principal.id
EOF
----

xref:policies:conditions.adoc[Conditions] are the powerful part of Cerbos which enables authorization decisions to be made at request time using context from both the principal (the user) and the resource they are trying to access. In this policy we are using conditions to check the department of the user for read and create actions, then again in the update and delete policy to check that the owner of the resource is the principal making the request.

As you are working on the policies, you can run the following to check that they are valid. If no errors are logged then you are good to go.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
cd cerbos
docker run -i -t -p 3592:3592 \
  -v $(pwd)/policies:/policies \
  {app-docker-img} \
  compile /policies
----

Now let's fire up the Cerbos PDP. We provide an image to do this easily -- simply run the following:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t -p 3592:3592 \
  -v $(pwd)/policies:/policies \
  {app-docker-img} \
  server
----

If everything is correct, we should see the following output:

[source,bash]
----
2022-12-07T16:43:40.626Z        INFO    cerbos.server   maxprocs: Leaving GOMAXPROCS=4: CPU quota undefined

2022-12-07T16:43:40.632Z        INFO    cerbos.grpc     Starting gRPC server at :3593
----

=== Setting up the server

Having now set up both our Cerbos policy and our Prisma database, it is time to implement our web server. For this example we will be using Express to set up a simple server running on port 3000. We will also import our Prisma and Cerbos clients which we will use later on.

[source,js]
----
mkdir src
cat << EOF > src/index.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";
import { GRPC } from "@cerbos/grpc";

const prisma = new PrismaClient({ log: ["query", "info", "warn", "error"] });
const cerbos = new GRPC("localhost:3592", { tls: false }); // The Cerbos PDP instance

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const server = app.listen(3000, () =>
  console.log("ðŸš€ Server ready at: http://localhost:3000")
);
EOF
----

Now we need to create our routes which we will authorize. For this simple example, we will create a `GET` for a contact resource.

Using the Prisma client, query for the contact which matches the ID of the URL parameter. If it is not found, return an error message. Add the following to `src/index.ts`:

[source,js]
----
// Implementing an authentication provider is out of scope of this article and you will more than likely already have one in place,
// So we build a static one here for indicative use
const user = {
  "id": "1", // user id
  "role": "user", // single role (user, admin)
  //"role": "admin",
  "department": "Sales" // department of the user
  //"department": "Marketing"
};

app.get("/contacts/:id", async ({ params }, res) => {
  // load the contact
  const contact = await prisma.contact.findUnique({
    where: {
      id: params.id,
    },
  });
  if (!contact) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Contact not found" });

  // TODO check authz and return a response
});
----

=== Authorizing requests

With our policy defined, we can call Cerbos from our request handler to authorize the principal to take the action on the resource.

To do this, we need to update our `GET` handler and replace the `TODO` with a call to Cerbos; passing in the details about the user and the attributes of the contact resource, as well as the action being made:

[source,js]
----
  // check user is authorized
  const decision = await cerbos.checkResource({
    principal: {
      id: `${user.id}`,
      roles: [user.role],
      attributes: {
        department: user.department,
      },
    },
    resource: {
      kind: "contact",
      id: contact.id + '',
      attributes: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(contact)),
    },
    actions: ["read"],
  });

  // authorized for read action
  if (decision.isAllowed("read")) {
    return res.json(contact);
  } else {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
----

In this case, we are only checking a single contact using the `checkResource` method. There is also a `checkResources` method available which supports batching resources into a single request (perhaps for use in a `list` endpoint). A `checkResources` call could be used like this:

[source,js]
----
  const decision = await cerbos.checkResources({
    principal: {
        id: `${user.id}`,
        roles: [user.role]
        attributes: {
          department: user.department,
        },
    },
    resources: [
      {
        resource: {
          kind: "contact",
          id: contact.id + '',
          attributes: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(contact)),
        },
        actions: ["read"],
      },
      ...
    ],
  });

  decision.isAllowed({
    resource: { kind: "contact", id: ${user.id} },
    action: "read",
  }); // => true
----

Once we get the response back from Cerbos, calling the `.isAllowed` method for the required action (and optionally, the given resource ID in the `checkResources` case) will return a simple boolean of whether the user is authorized or not. Using this, we can either return the contact or throw an `HTTP 403 Unauthorized` response.

=== The query planner

If we provide Cerbos with a `principal`, a description of the `resource` they're trying to access and the required `action`, we can ask it for a query plan.

Start by installing the following dependency:

[source,bash]
----
npm i express @cerbos/orm-prisma
----

Then add the following to `index.js`:

[source,js]
----
import { queryPlanToPrisma, PlanKind } from "@cerbos/orm-prisma";

app.get("/contacts", async (req, res) => {
  // Fetch the query plan from Cerbos passing in the principal
  // resource type and action
  const contactQueryPlan = await cerbos.planResources({
    principal: {
      id: `${user.id}`,
      roles: [user.role],
      attributes: {
        department: user.department,
      },
    },
    resource: {
      kind: "contact",
    },
    action: "read",
  });

  // TODO convert query plan to a Prisma adapater instance
});
----

We can then use the https://github.com/cerbos/query-plan-adapters/blob/main/prisma/README.md[Cerbos Prisma ORM adapter] to convert this query plan response, like so:

[source,js]
----
  const queryPlanResult = queryPlanToPrisma({
    queryPlan: contactQueryPlan,
    // map or function to change field names to match the prisma model
    fieldNameMapper: {
      "request.resource.attr.ownerId": "ownerId",
      "request.resource.attr.department": "department",
      "request.resource.attr.active": "active",
      "request.resource.attr.marketingOptIn": "marketingOptIn",
    },
  });

  let contacts: any[];

  if (queryPlanResult.kind === PlanKind.ALWAYS_DENIED) {
    contacts = [];
  } else {
    // Pass the filters in as where conditions
    // If you have prexisting where conditions, you can pass them in an AND clause
    contacts = await prisma.contact.findMany({
      where: {
        AND: queryPlanResult.filters
      },
      select: {
        firstName: true,
        lastName: true,
        active: true,
        marketingOptIn: true,
      },
    });
  }

  return res.json({
    contacts,
  });
----

In the case that the result `kind` is not `ALWAYS_DENIED`, we retrieve the filters from the adapter instance, and use them to construct a query using the Prisma ORM.

=== Trying it out

Run the Cerbos PDP, as described above, and separately, fire up the node server as follows:

[source,bash]
----
npx ts-node src/index.ts
----

Then, hit it with some requests:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://localhost:3000/contacts/1
curl -i http://localhost:3000/contacts
----

=== Conclusion

Through this simple example, we have used Primsa as our ORM to create a REST API which is authorized using Cerbos for a simple CRM system. This can be built upon to add more complex requirements, for example:

* Checking the IP address of the request to ensure it is within the corporate IP range
* Check if the incoming change is within an acceptable boundary eg only allow 20% discounts on a product unless an admin
* Ensure only certain actions are done during work-hours

You can find a sample repo of integrating Primsa and Cerbos in an Express server on https://github.com/cerbos/express-prisma-cerbos/[Github], as well as many other example projects of implementing Cerbos.
