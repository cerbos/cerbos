= Install from Helm chart

Add the Cerbos Helm repository:

[source,sh,subs="attributes,macros"]
----
helm repo add cerbos {app-helm-chart-repo}
helm repo update
----

You can view all the available configuration values for the chart by running the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
helm show values cerbos/cerbos --version={app-version}
----

[NOTE]
====

Cerbos Helm chart is also available from an link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/[OCI registry].

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1 helm install cerbos oci://ghcr.io/cerbos/helm-charts/cerbos --version={app-version}
----

====

.Securing Cerbos with TLS
****

Cerbos endpoints can be secured with TLS by providing a secret containing the certificate and its private key in the link:https://cert-manager.io[cert-manager] format:

`tls.crt`:: Certificate chain. Required.
`tls.key`:: Private key. Required.
`ca.crt`:: Trust chain. Optional.

During installation, provide the name of the Kubernetes secret containing the certificates by using the `cerbos.tlsSecretName` value.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install cerbos cerbos/cerbos --version={app-version} --set=cerbos.tlsSecretName=my-certificate-secret
----

If you require advanced features such as automatic certificate reloading, workload identities or mTLS, we recommend deploying a proxy server like link:https://www.envoyproxy.io[Envoy], link:https://github.com/ghostunnel/ghostunnel[Ghostunnel] or link:https://traefik.io[Traefik] as a frontend to the Cerbos server. See the xref:deployment:k8s-sidecar.adoc[Kubernetes sidecar] documentation for an example of deploying Cerbos as a sidecar to Ghostunnel.

== Customizing the manifests

For the sake of simplicity, the Cerbos Helm chart only exposes settings that are most likely to be changed in a typical deployment scenario. If you want to customize the manifests further, use the post-renderer functionality in Helm to patch the generated manifests before they are applied.

For example, if you want to set `loadBalancerSourceRanges` of the service generated by the Cerbos Helm chart, you can use Kustomize to patch the service as follows:

Create a file named `kustomization.yaml` with the patches you want to apply:

[source,yaml]
----
---
resources:
  - base.yaml
patches:
  - patch: |-
      - op: add
        path: /spec/loadBalancerSourceRanges
        values: ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    target:
      version: v1
      kind: Service
----

Create a file named `kustomize.sh` with the following contents and make it executable:

[source,sh]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cat > base.yaml
exec kubectl kustomize
----

Test that the patch works as expected:

[source,sh]
----
helm template cerbos/cerbos --post-renderer ./kustomize.sh
----

Now you can install Cerbos with your patches:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install cerbos cerbos/cerbos --version={app-version} --post-renderer=./kustomize.sh
----


== Deploy Cerbos configured to read policies from a GitHub repository

* Follow the instructions at https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token to create a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` permissions.
* Create a new Kubernetes secret to hold the PAT
+
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
PAT=YOUR_GITHUB_PAT kubectl create secret generic cerbos-github-token --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN=$PAT
----

* Create a new values file named `git-values.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: cerbos-github-token <1>

cerbos:
  config:
    # Configure the git storage driver
    storage:
      driver: "git"
      git:
        protocol: https
        # Replace with the URL of your GitHub repo.
        url: https://github.com/cerbos/sample-policies.git
        # Replace with the branch name of your repo.
        branch: main
        # Remove or leave empty if the policies are not stored in a subdirectory.
        subDir: hr
        # Path to checkout. By default, /work is a Kubernetes emptyDir volume that is only available for the lifetime of the pod.
        # If you want the work directory to persist between pod restarts, specify the mount path of a persistent volume here.
        checkoutDir: /work
        # How often the remote repo should be checked for updates.
        updatePollInterval: 60s
        # Credentials used to login to the remote GitHub repo. We are using an environment variable mounted from the secret we created earlier.
        https:
          username: ${GITHUB_TOKEN} <2>
          password: "" <3>
----
<1> Create an environment variable from the secret we created
<2> Use the environment variable containing the PAT as the username to login to GitHub
<3> Password should be empty when using a PAT to authenticate to GitHub

* Deploy Cerbos using the Helm chart
+
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install cerbos cerbos/cerbos --version={app-version} --values=git-values.yaml
----



== Deploy Cerbos configured to read policies from a mounted volume

Here we demonstrate how to use a `hostPath` volume to feed policies to a Cerbos deployment. You can easily substitute the `hostPath` volume type with any other type of volumes supported by Kubernetes. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/.

* Create a new values file named `pv-values.yaml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
volumes: <1>
  - name: cerbos-policies
    hostPath:
      path: /data/cerbos-policies

volumeMounts: <2>
  - name: cerbos-policies
    mountPath: /policies
    readOnly: true

cerbos:
  config:
    storage:
      driver: "disk"
      disk:
        directory: /policies <3>
        watchForChanges: true
----
<1> Define a `hostPath` volume type
<2> Mount the volume to the container at the path `/policies`
<3> Configure Cerbos to read policies from the mounted `/policies` directory


* Deploy Cerbos using the Helm chart
+
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install cerbos cerbos/cerbos --version={app-version} --values=pv-values.yaml
----
