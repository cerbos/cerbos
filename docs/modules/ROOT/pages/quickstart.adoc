= Quickstart


Create a directory to store the policies.

[source,sh]
----
mkdir -p cerbos-quickstart/policies
----

Now start the Cerbos server. We are using the container image in this guide but you can follow along using the binary as well. See xref:installation/binary.adoc[installation instructions] for more information.

.Downloading the container image
****

During the early access period you will need to login to the container registry using the provided Cerbos key.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
echo CERBOS_KEY | docker login {app-container-registry} -u cerbos-ea --password-stdin
----

****

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run --rm --name cerbos -d -v $(pwd)/cerbos-quickstart/policies:/policies -p 3592:3592 {app-docker-img} 
----

Launch a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3592/. You will be presented with a webpage with documentation about the Cerbos API. Click on the `/api/check` endpoint to follow the rest of this quickstart guide.

Click on btn:[Example] tab to view an example of a request you can make to Cerbos. In the example, the `bugs_bunny` principal is trying to perform two actions (`view:public` and `comment`) on two `album:object` resource instances. The resource instance with the ID `XX125` belongs to `bugs_bunny` and is private (`public` attribute is `false`). The other resource instance with the ID `XX225` belongs to `daffy_duck` and is public.

Click on the btn:[Try] button to try out the example request.

NOTE: If you prefer to use link:https://www.postman.com[Postman], link:https://insomnia.rest[Insomnia] or any other software that supports OpenAPI, you can follow this guide along on those tools by downloading the OpenAPI definitions from http://localhost:3592{cerbos-openapi-schema}. 

image::request_00.png[Request]

The response from the server denies `bugs_bunny` from viewing or commenting on any of the album resources â€” even the ones that belong to him. This is because currently there no policies defined for the `album:object`.

Let's create a xref:policies:derived_roles.adoc[derived roles] definition that assigns the `owner` dynamic role to a user if the `owner` attribute of the resource they are trying to access is equal to their ID.

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/derived_roles_common.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: "api.cerbos.dev/v1"
derivedRoles:
  name: common_roles
  definitions:
    - name: owner
      parentRoles: ["user"]
      condition:
        match:
          expr: request.resource.attr.owner == request.principal.id
EOF
----

Let's also create a resource policy that gives ``owner``s full access to their own albums. 

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/resource_album.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: "default"
  importDerivedRoles:
    - common_roles
  resource: "album:object"
  rules:
    - actions: ['*']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      derivedRoles:
        - owner
EOF
----

Try the request again. This time `bugs_bunny` should be allowed access to his own album but denied access to the album owned by `daffy_duck`. 

image::request_01.png[Request]

Now let's add a rule to the policy to allow users to view public albums.

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/resource_album.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: "default"
  importDerivedRoles:
    - common_roles
  resource: "album:object"
  rules:
    - actions: ['*']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      derivedRoles:
        - owner

    - actions: ['view:public']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - user
      condition:
        match:
          expr: request.resource.attr.public == true
EOF
----

If you try the request again, `bugs_bunny` now has `view:public` access to the album owned by `daffy_duck` but not `comment` access. Can you figure out how to update the policy to give him `comment` access as well?

image::request_02.png[Request]

Once you are done experimenting, the Cerbos server can be stopped with the following command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
docker kill cerbos
----
