Create a directory to store the policies.

[source,sh]
----
mkdir -p cerbos-quickstart/policies
----

Now start the Cerbos server. We are using the container image in this guide but you can follow along using the binary as well. See xref:installation/binary.adoc[installation instructions] for more information.

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run --rm --name cerbos -d -v $(pwd)/cerbos-quickstart/policies:/policies -p 3592:3592 -p 3593:3593  {app-docker-img}
----

Time to try out a simple request.

NOTE: If you prefer to use link:https://www.postman.com[Postman], link:https://insomnia.rest[Insomnia] or any other software that supports OpenAPI, you can follow this guide along on those tools by downloading the OpenAPI definitions from http://localhost:3592{cerbos-openapi-schema}. You can also use the built-in API browser by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3592.

In this example, the `bugs_bunny` principal is trying to perform two actions (`view:public` and `comment`) on two `album:object` resources. The resource instance with the ID `BUGS001` belongs to `bugs_bunny` and is private (`public` attribute is `false`). The other resource instance with the ID `DAFFY002` belongs to `daffy_duck` and is public.

This is the response from the server:

.Response
[source,json]
----
{
  "requestId": "quickstart",
  "results": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "id": "BUGS001",
        "kind": "album:object"
      },
      "actions": {
        "comment": "EFFECT_DENY",
        "view:public": "EFFECT_DENY"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "id": "DAFFY002",
        "kind": "album:object"
      },
      "actions": {
        "comment": "EFFECT_DENY",
        "view:public": "EFFECT_DENY"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----


Bugs Bunny is not allowed to view or comment on any of the album resources â€” even the ones that belong to him. This is because currently there are no policies defined for the `album:object` resource.

Now create a xref:policies:derived_roles.adoc[derived roles] definition that assigns the `owner` dynamic role to a user if the `owner` attribute of the resource they're trying to access is equal to their ID.

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/derived_roles_common.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: "api.cerbos.dev/v1"
derivedRoles:
  name: common_roles
  definitions:
    - name: owner
      parentRoles: ["user"]
      condition:
        match:
          expr: request.resource.attr.owner == request.principal.id
EOF
----

Also create a resource policy that gives ``owner``s full access to their own albums. 

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/resource_album.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: "default"
  importDerivedRoles:
    - common_roles
  resource: "album:object"
  rules:
    - actions: ['*']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      derivedRoles:
        - owner
EOF
----

Try the request again. This time `bugs_bunny` should be allowed access to his own album but denied access to the album owned by `daffy_duck`.

      },
      "actions": {
        "comment": "EFFECT_ALLOW",
        "view:public": "EFFECT_ALLOW"
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "id": "DAFFY002",
        "kind": "album:object"
      },
      "actions": {
        "comment": "EFFECT_DENY",
        "view:public": "EFFECT_DENY"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Now add a rule to the policy to allow users to view public albums.

[source,sh]
----
cat > cerbos-quickstart/policies/resource_album.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: "default"
  importDerivedRoles:
    - common_roles
  resource: "album:object"
  rules:
    - actions: ['*']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      derivedRoles:
        - owner

    - actions: ['view:public']
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - user
      condition:
        match:
          expr: request.resource.attr.public == true
EOF
----

If you try the request again, `bugs_bunny` now has `view:public` access to the album owned by `daffy_duck` but not `comment` access. Can you figure out how to update the policy to give him `comment` access as well?

Once you are done experimenting, the Cerbos server can be stopped with the following command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
docker kill cerbos
