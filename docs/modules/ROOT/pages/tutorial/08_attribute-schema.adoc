= Attribute schema

NOTE: The policies for this section can be found link:{tutorial-base}/09-attribute-schema/cerbos[on GitHub].

An additional check bit of business logic has been introduced for the `contact` resource which requires the `active` attribute of a contact to be set to `True` to be able to `update` or `delete` it. This is so that old contacts are kept for reporting purposes and can't be accidentally deleted or updated.

This now means there are two attributes of a `contact` resource that are now required for the policies to be computed - `ownerId` and `active`. If either of these is not included in the request to check permissions the result would not be as expected (defaulting to `EFFECT_DENY`).

To prevent this mistake, it is possible to define a xref:policies:schemas.adoc[schema] for the attributes of a principal and resources which Cerbos validates against at request time to ensure all fields are provided as expected.

== Defining schema

xref:policies:schemas.adoc[Attribute schema] are defined in https://json-schema.org/specification.html[JSON Schema (draft 2020-12)] and stored in a special `_schemas` sub-directory along side the policies

For the contact resource the schema looks like the following:

[source,json]
----
include::example$tutorial/09-attribute-schema/cerbos/policies/_schemas/contact.json[]
----

Once defined, it is then linked to the resource via adding a reference in the policy:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$tutorial/09-attribute-schema/cerbos/policies/contact.yaml[]
----

The same can be done with attributes of a principal - you can find out more in xref:policies:schemas.adoc[the documentation].

== Enforcing schema

Validating the request against the schema is done at request time by the server - to enable this a xref:configuration:schema.adoc[new schema configuration block] needs adding to the `.cerbos.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
schema:
  enforcement: reject
----

With this now in place, any request that is made to check authorization of a `contact` resource is rejected if the attributes are not provided or of the wrong type:

_Request_

  "principal": {
    "id": "user_1",

          "ownerId": "user1"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "actions": ["read"]
}

        {
          "message": "missing properties: 'active'",
          "source": "SOURCE_RESOURCE"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
