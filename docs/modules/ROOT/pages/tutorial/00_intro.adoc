== Cerbforce

'Cerbforce' is the new killer CRM system that is taking the world by storm. It began as a small SaaS app that has grown into an enterprise-scale, multi-tenant, global powerhouse.

It is now at the point where the existing basic permission model created at the start of development is no longer fit for purpose and https://cerbos.dev/[Cerbos] has been selected as the system to implement.

This tutorial walks through the decision-making process for implementing https://cerbos.dev/[Cerbos]. It covers setting up, defining the various resources and policies for the different objects and users in the system, and evolve them to make use of all of Cerbos' features.
