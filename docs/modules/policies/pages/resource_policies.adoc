----
<1> Version of this policy. Policies are uniquely identified by the resource name and version pair. You can have multiple policy versions for the same resource (e.g. production vs. staging). `default` version is special as it is the fallback when no version is specified.
<2> Import a set of derived roles.
<3> Name of the resource to which this policy applies.
<4> Actions can contain wildcards. Wildcards honour the `:` delimiter. E.g. `a:*:d` would match `a:x:d` but not `a:x`.
<5> This rule applies to a derived role.
<6> Rules can also refer directly to static roles.
