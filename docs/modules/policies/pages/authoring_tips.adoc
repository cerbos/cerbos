= Policy authoring 

== Tips for working with policies

* Policies can be in either YAML or JSON formats. Accepted file extensions are `.yml`, `.yaml` or `.json`. All other extensions are ignored.
* The JSON schema for Cerbos policies is available at `{current-policy-schema-url}` and xref:compile.adoc[tests] at `{current-test-schema-url}`. If you prefer to always use the latest version, it can be accessed at `{latest-policy-schema-url}` and `{latst-test-schema-url}`. 

== Policy structure

* The policy header is common for all policy types:
** `apiVersion`: Required. Must be `api.cerbos.dev/v1`.
** `description`: Optional. Description of the policy.
** `disabled`: Optional. Set to `true` to make the Cerbos engine ignore this policy file.
** `metadata.sourceFile`: Optional. Set to the source of the policy data for auditing purposes.
** `metadata.annotations`: Optional. Key-value pairs of strings holding free-form data for auditing purposes.
* Resource names, actions, and principal names can be hierarchical. Use `:` as the delimiter. For example: `app:component:resource`.
* Wildcard matches are allowed on certain fields. Wildcards respect the hierarchy delimiter `:`.
* xref:scoped_policies.adoc[Scoped policies] (optional) are handy for use cases like multi-tenancy where you may want to override particular rules for some tenants.
* See xref:conditions.adoc[Conditions] to learn how to write conditions in policy rules.
* See xref:schemas.adoc[Schemas] to learn how you can define schemas for validating requests.
* See xref:best_practices.adoc[Best practices] to check out a growing collection of snippets detailing the optimal way to write policies.

== Editing policies

The quickest and the easiest way to get familiar with Cerbos policies is to use the link:https://play.cerbos.dev[online playground]. It provides an IDE-like experience with an interactive editor, examples, code snippets, test cases and other useful utilities to help you design policies.


=== Editor configurations

Editors with support for the link:https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol (LSP)] can make use of the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server[YAML language server] implementation when working with Cerbos policies. Simply add the following line at the beginning of your policy file to get context-sensitive code suggestions and validation messages from the editor.

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema={latest-policy-schema-url}
----

The same method can be used for xref:compile.adoc[tests]:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
# yaml-language-server: $schema={latest-test-schema-url}
----

YAML language server also supports per-directory settings. If all your Cerbos policies are contained in a specific directory, you can configure the editor to always use the correct schema for the YAML files in that directory. Refer to the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#language-server-settings=[YAML language server documentation] for more information.

.Example: Apply the schema to all files in the /cerbos directory
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
yaml.schemas: {
    "{latest-policy-schema-url}": "/cerbos/*",
    "{latest-test-schema-url}": "/cerbos/**/*_test.yaml",
}
----

==== Neovim 

Easiest way to get started is to install the link:https://github.com/lspcontainers/lspcontainers.nvim[lspcontainer.nvim] plugin. With link:https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim[Packer], you can use a configuration similar to the following:

[source,lua,subs="+attributes"]
----
use({ 'lspcontainers/lspcontainers.nvim' })

use({ 
    'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    config = function()
        lspconfig = require "lspconfig"
        lspcontainers = require "lspcontainers"
        ...
        lspconfig.yamlls.setup {
            before_init = function(params)
                params.processId = vim.NIL
            end,
            cmd = lspcontainers.command('yamlls', { network = "bridge", }),
            root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern(".git", vim.fn.getcwd()),
            on_attach = on_attach,
            capabilities = capabilities,
            settings = {
                yaml = {
                    schemas = {
                        "{latest-policy-schema-url}": "/cerbos/*",
                        "{latest-test-schema-url}": "/cerbos/**/*_test.yaml"
                    },
                },
            },
        }
    end,
})
----

==== JetBrains IDEs

Navigate to the menu:Preferences[Languages & Frameworks > Schemas and DTDs > JSON Schema Mappings] in JetBrains IDE of your choice.

Add an entry with the following configuration:

[subs="attributes"]
----
Name: Cerbos
Schema file or URL: {latest-policy-schema-url}
Schema version: JSON Schema Version 7
File path pattern: cerbos/*
----
image:jetbrains-menu.png[alt="JetBrains JSON Schema Mappings menu",role="center-img"]

NOTE: In the example above, the schema is applied to all files in the cerbos directory.

==== Visual Studio Code

If you are new to Visual Studio Code, refer to the
link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings[documentation] for more information about how to change settings.

Install the YAML language server extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml

After the extension is installed, hit kbd:[Ctrl+,] or menu:File[Preferences > Settings] to edit settings. Expand menu:Extensions[YAML], click `Edit in settings.json` under `Yaml: Schemas`. and add the following snippet:

[source,json,subs="attributes"]
----
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "{latest-policy-schema-url}": "cerbos/*",
    "{latest-test-schema-url}": "/cerbos/tests/*",
  }
}
----

NOTE: In the example above, the schema is applied to all files in the cerbos directory.
