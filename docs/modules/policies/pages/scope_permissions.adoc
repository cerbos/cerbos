== Overview

`scopePermissions` is a setting applied to all policies that impacts how rules are evaluated within a scope hierarchy. It defines whether policies in a given scope can **override** parent scope rules or whether they can only **restrict** the permissions granted by parent scopes.

All policies within the same scope **must** use the same `scopePermissions` setting. If conflicting settings are detected within a shared scope, a build-time error will occur.

There are two available settings:

- `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT`
- `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS`

NOTE: By default, resource and principal policies use `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT` unless explicitly set otherwise.

IMPORTANT: Role policies require this field to be specified explicitly.

== Scope permissions
=== SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT

This is the default evaluation strategy for scoped policies. Cerbos starts evaluating policies from the bottom of the scope chain and moves up. The first policy to produce a decision for a given action is the winner. Any policies further up the chain cannot influence that decision.


=== SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS

When a policy is configured with `scopePermissions: SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS`, it **inherits and restricts** the permissions of parent scopes. Policies at this level must define rules within the maximum set of permissions allowed by parent policies—they cannot introduce new permissions that exceed what a parent scope already permits.

Policies using this setting must be at the leaf nodes of the scope hierarchy, meaning there can only be a single optional layer of `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS`, with all scopes above it using `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT`.

If an input does not match an explicit rule in a `REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT` policy, it must continue up the scope hierarchy for evaluation. However, if a rule is matched but its condition is not met, the request is implicitly denied.


== Policy-specific behaviour

The behaviour of `scopePermissions` differs depending on whether it is applied to **resource policies**, **principal policies**, or **role policies**.

=== Resource and principal policies

For resource and principal policies with `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS`, permissions must be defined within the maximum set of `ALLOW` rules from parent policies. Policies at this level can override parent permissions, but **only within the limits already permitted by parent scopes**.

- If an input is not matched, evaluation continues up the scope hierarchy.
- If a rule is matched but its condition is not met, an implicit DENY is issued.
- If a rule matches and the condition is met, evaluation continues to parent policies to verify that the action is also allowed at a higher level.

In contrast, resource and principal policies with `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT` behave as follows:

- If an input matches a rule and its condition is met, the specified effect is applied (no need to check parents).
- If a rule is matched but its condition is not met, or if a rule is not matched, evaluation continues up the hierarchy.

=== Role Policies

Role policies function differently because they do not use explicit `ALLOW` or `DENY` effects. Instead, they define a set of allowable actions, which default to `ALLOW`.

For role policies with `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_REQUIRE_PARENTAL_CONSENT_FOR_ALLOWS`:

- If a matching resource-action pair is found and the condition is met, evaluation continues up in the parent scopes.
- If a matching resource-action pair is found but the condition is not met, or if a resource-action pair is not defined, an implicit DENY is issued for the named role.
- Other roles are evaluated independently. If one role allows an action while another denies it, the `ALLOW` takes precedence for that action.

For role policies with `SCOPE_PERMISSIONS_OVERRIDE_PARENT`:

- If a matching resource-action pair is found and the condition is met, an ALLOW is immediately issued.
- If a matching resource-action pair is found but the condition is not met, or if a resource-action pair is not defined, evaluation continues up the hierarchy.
