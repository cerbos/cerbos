= Validating and testing policies

include::ROOT:partial$version-check.adoc[]


== Validating policies

You can use the Cerbos compiler to make sure that your policies are valid before pushing them to a production Cerbos instance. We recommend setting up a git hook or a CI step to run the Cerbos compiler before you push any policy changes to production.

docker run -i -t -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies {app-docker-img} compile /policies

== Testing policies

You can write optional tests for policies and run them as part of the compilation stage to make sure that the policies do exactly what you expect.

Tests are defined using the familiar YAML format as well. A test file must have `_test` suffix in the name and one of the following file extensions: `yaml`, `yml`, or `json`. For example, `album_test.yml`, `album_test.yaml` or `album_test.json`.

=== Sharing test fixtures

It is possible to share principals, resources and auxData blocks between test suites stored in the same directory. Create a `testdata` directory in the directory containing your test suite files, then define shared resources, principals and auxData in `testdata/resources.yml`, `testdata/principals.yml`, `testdata/auxdata.yml` respectively (`yaml` and `json` extensions are also supported).

[NOTE]
====

link:https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors[YAML anchors and overrides] are a great way to reduce repetition and reuse definitions in test cases.

For example, the following definitions are equivalent:

[options="header",cols="a,a"]

=== Running tests

The `compile` command automatically discovers test files in the policy repository.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t \
    -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies \
    {app-docker-img} compile /policies
----


The output format can be controlled using the `--output` flag, which accepts the values `tree` (default), `list` and `json`. The `--color` flag controls the coloring of the output. To produce machine readable output from the tests, pass `--output=json --color=never` to the command.


By default, all discovered tests are run. Use the `--skip-tests` flag to skip all tests or use the `--run` flag to run a set of tests that match a regular expression.

.Example: Running only tests that contain 'Delete' in the name
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t \
    -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies \
    {app-docker-img} compile --run=Delete /policies
----

You can mark entire suites or individual tests in a suite with `skip: true` to skip them during test runs.

.Example: Skipping a test
[source,yaml]
----
---
name: AlbumObjectTestSuite
description: Tests for verifying the album:object resource policy
tests:
  - name: View private album
    skip: true
    skipReason: "Policy under review"
    input:
      principals: ["alicia"]
      resources: ["alicia_private_album"]
      actions: ["view"]
    expected:
      - principal: alicia
        resource: alicia_private_album
        actions:
          view: EFFECT_ALLOW

== Validating and testing policies in CI environments

Because Cerbos artefacts are distributed as self-contained containers and binaries, you should be able to easily integrate Cerbos into any CI environment. Simply configure your workflow to execute the commands described in the sections above using either the Cerbos container (you may need to configure mount points to suit your repo structure) or the binary.


=== GitHub Actions

- link:https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-setup-action[cerbos-setup-action]: Install `cerbos` and `cerbosctl` binaries into your workflow tools cache
- link:https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-compile-action[cerbos-compile-action]: Compile and (optionally) test Cerbos policies
