= Validating and testing policies

== Validating policies

You can use the Cerbos compiler to make sure that your policies are valid before pushing them to a production Cerbos instance. We recommend setting up a git hook or a CI step to run the Cerbos compiler before you push any policy changes to production.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies {app-docker-img} compile /policies

[#testing]
== Testing policies

You can write optional tests for policies and run them as part of the compilation stage to make sure that the policies do exactly what you expect.

Tests are defined using the familiar YAML format as well. Make sure that your tests are in a separate directory from the policies to avoid confusion. We recommend storing them in a top-level directory named `tests`. A test file must have `_test` suffix in the name and one of the following file extensions: 'yaml', 'yml', or 'json'. For example, `album_test.yml`, `album_test.yaml` or `album_test.json`.

<4> Map of principal fixtures. The key is a string that can be used to refer to the associated principal.
<5> Map of resource fixtures. The key is a string that can be used to refer to the associated resource.
<6> Map of (optional) auxiliary data fixtures required to evaluate some requests. The key is a string that can be used to refer to the associated auxData.

<9> Optional RFC3339 timestamp to be used as the return value of the `now` function. Applies to this test only and takes precedence over the global suite option.
<10> Input to the policy engine
<11> List of keys of principal fixtures to test
<12> List of keys of resource fixtures to test
<13> List of actions to test
<14> Key of auxiliary data fixture to test (optional)
<15> List of outcomes expected for each principal and resource. If a principal+resource pair specified in `input` is not listed in `expected`, then `EFFECT_DENY` is expected for all actions for that pair.
<16> Key of the principal fixture under test
<17> Key of the resource fixture under test
<18> Expected outcomes for each action for the principal+resource pair

=== Sharing test fixtures

It is possible to share principals, resources and auxData blocks between test suites stored in the same directory. Create a `testdata` directory in the directory containing your test suite files, then define shared resources, principals and auxData in `testdata/resources.yml`, `testdata/principals.yml`, `testdata/auxdata.yml` respectively (`yaml` and `json` extensions are also supported).

[NOTE]
====

link:https://www.educative.io/blog/advanced-yaml-syntax-cheatsheet#anchors[YAML anchors and overrides] are a great way to reduce repetition and reuse definitions in test cases.

For example, the following definitions are equivalent:

[options="header",cols="a,a"]

=== Running tests

To run the tests, provide the path to the tests directory using the `--tests` flag.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t \
    -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies \
    -v /path/to/test/dir:/tests \
    {app-docker-img} compile --tests=/tests /policies
----


Machine readable output can be produced by passing `--format=json` flag to the command.


By default, all discovered tests are run. To run just some of the tests, provide a regular expression that matches the test using the `--run` flag.

.Example: Running only tests that contain 'Delete' in the name
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker run -i -t \
    -v /path/to/policy/dir:/policies \
    -v /path/to/test/dir:/tests \
    {app-docker-img} compile --tests=/tests --run=Delete /policies
----

You can also skip entire suites or individual tests in a suite by adding `skip: true` to the test definition.

.Example: Skipping a test
[source,yaml]
----
---
name: AlbumObjectTestSuite
description: Tests for verifying the album:object resource policy
tests:
  - name: View private album
    skip: true
    skipReason: "Policy under review"
    input:
      principals: ["alicia"]
      resources: ["alicia_private_album"]
      actions: ["view"]
    expected:
      - principal: alicia
        resource: alicia_private_album
        actions:
          view: EFFECT_ALLOW

== Validating and testing policies in CI environments

Because Cerbos artefacts are distributed as self-contained containers and binaries, you should be able to easily integrate Cerbos into any CI environment. Simply configure your workflow to execute the commands described in the sections above using either the Cerbos container (you may need to configure mount points to suit your repo structure) or the binary.


=== GitHub Actions

- link:https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-setup-action[cerbos-setup-action]: Install `cerbos` and `cerbosctl` binaries into your workflow tools cache
- link:https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-compile-action[cerbos-compile-action]: Compile and (optionally) test Cerbos policies
