= Variables

You can use variables to reduce duplication in xref:conditions.adoc[policy condition expressions]. Variables may either be defined locally within a policy, or in a standalone `exportVariables` policy file that can be imported by other policies.

== Defining local variables

Local variables are only accessible from the policy they are defined. In particular, local variables defined for derived roles can't be used in resource policies that import the derived roles.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  variables:
    local: <1>
      flagged_resource: request.resource.attr.flagged
      label: '"latest"' # assigning a string literal
      teams: '["red", "blue"]' # assigning an array
  # ...
----
<1> Map of variable name to expression.

[#export]
== Defining and importing exported variables

To reuse variables between policies, they can be exported from a separate file.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
description: Common variables used within the Apatr app
exportVariables:
  name: apatr_common_variables <1>
  definitions: <2>
    flagged_resource: request.resource.attr.flagged
    label: '"latest"' # assigning a string literal
    teams: '["red", "blue"]' # assigning an array
----
<1> Name to use when importing this set of variables.
<2> Map of variable name to expression.

Other policies can then import the variables by name.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  variables:
    import: <1>
      - apatr_common_variables
  # ...
----
<1> List of names of variable sets to import.

== Using variables in policy conditions

Variables can be referenced via the `variables` (aliased to `V`) special variable in policy condition expressions.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
---
condition:
  match:
    expr: variables.flagged_resource
----

Local and imported variable definitions are merged, and each variable is evaluated before any rule condition. If a variable is defined in more than one location, the policy will fail to compile.

== Top-level variables field

In earlier versions of Cerbos, local variables were defined in a top-level `variables` field in the policy file. This field is deprecated in favour of the `variables.local` section within the policy body. For backwards compatibility, the deprecated top-level field is merged with the `variables.local` section in derived roles, resource, and principal policies.
