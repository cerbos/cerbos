= Tutorial: Using Cerbos with Auth0


An example application of integrating https://cerbos.dev[Cerbos] with an https://expressjs.com/[Express] server using https://auth0.com/[Auth0] for authentication.

== Dependencies

* Node.js
* Docker for running the xref:ROOT:installation/container.adoc[Cerbos Policy Decision Point (PDP)]
* An https://auth0.com/[Auth0] account if you want to use your own

== Getting Started

. Clone the repo
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:cerbos/express-auth0-cerbos.git
----

. Start up the Cerbos PDP instance docker container. This will be called
by the express app to check authorization.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd cerbos
./start.sh
----

. Install node dependencies
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

. Start the express server
+
[source,bash]
----
node index.js
----

== Auth0 Rule to add roles to token

By default any roles set up in the Auth0 console are not passed through
in the authentication token. To enable this, add the following rule to
the Auth Pipeline in your Auth0 account.

[source,js]
----
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = 'https://cerbos.cloud';
  const assignedRoles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  let idTokenClaims = context.idToken || {};
  let accessTokenClaims = context.accessToken || {};

  idTokenClaims[`${namespace}/roles`] = assignedRoles;
  accessTokenClaims[`${namespace}/roles`] = assignedRoles;

  context.idToken = idTokenClaims;
  context.accessToken = accessTokenClaims;

  callback(null, user, context);
}
----

== Policies

This example has a simple CRUD policy in place for a resource kind of
`contact` - like a CRM system would have. The policy file can be found
in the `cerbos/policies` folder
https://github.com/cerbos/express-auth0-cerbos/blob/main/cerbos/policies/contact.yaml[here].

Should you wish to experiment with this policy, you can try it in the
https://play.cerbos.dev/p/g561543292ospj7w0zOrFx7H5DzhmLu2[Cerbos Playground].

The policy expects one of two roles to be set on the principal - `admin`
and `user`. These roles are authorized as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Action |User |Admin
|list |Y |Y
|read |Y |Y
|create |N |Y
|update |N |Y
|delete |N |Y
|===

This business logic is represented in Cerbos as a resource policy.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: api.cerbos.dev/v1
resourcePolicy:
  version: default
  resource: contact
  rules:
    - actions: ["read", "create"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - admin
        - user

    - actions: ["update", "delete"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - admin

    - actions: ["update", "delete"]
      effect: EFFECT_ALLOW
      roles:
        - user
      condition:
        match:
          expr: request.resource.attr.owner == request.principal.id
